<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>This book has only two footnotes and they have been placed very
close to their anchors. These anchors are denoted by <span class="fnanchor">[A]</span>
and <span class="fnanchor">[B]</span>.</p>

<p>The Table of Contents has been created by the transcriber and is
hereby placed in the public domain.</p>

<p>This edition of the diary was self-published in 1881 by the author
John Ransom. It had first been printed some years earlier in a
Michigan newspaper. Many minor printer’s errors have been corrected
in this etext, and are noted at the <a href="#TN">end of the book</a>. Misspellings
in the diary text have been left unchanged.</p>

<p>The ‘List of the Dead’ is printed following the diary itself and is
essentially a reprint, in a similar but different format, of the
source document held in the Library of Congress. This source list
was compiled by the efforts of Dorence Atwater and Clara Barton, and
can now be viewed online at https://www.loc.gov/item/37031864</p>

<p>This records the deaths of prisoners which occurred in the fourteen
months between March 1864 and April 1865. It is organized by State,
and names are listed alphabetically by first letter only. More
details can be found in the Transcriber Note at the <a href="#TN">end of the book</a>.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>The book to which these lines form an introduction is a peculiar
one in many respects. It is a story, but it is a true story, and
written years ago with little idea that it would ever come into this
form. The writer has been induced, only recently, by the advice
of friends and by his own feeling that such a production would be
appreciated, to present what, at the time it was being made up,
was merely a means of occupying a mind which had to contemplate,
besides, only the horrors of a situation from which death
would have been, and was to thousands, a happy relief.</p>

<p>The original diary in which these writings were made from day
to day was destroyed by fire some years after the war, but its contents
had been printed in a series of letters to the Jackson, (Mich.)
<cite>Citizen</cite>, and to the editor and publisher of that journal thanks are
now extended for the privilege of using his files for the preparation
of this work. There has been little change in the entries in
the diary, before presenting them here. In such cases the words
which suggest themselves at the time are best—they cannot be improved
upon by substitution at a later day.</p>

<p>This book is essentially different from any other that has been
published concerning the “late war” or any of its incidents. Those
who have had any such experience as the author will see its truthfulness
at once, and to all other readers it is commended as a statement
of actual things by one who experienced them to the fullest.</p>

<p>The annexed list of the Andersonville dead is from the rebel
official records, is authentic, and will be found valuable in many
pension cases and otherwise.</p>

<p>A REBEL RUSE TO GOBBLE UP UNION TROOPS—A COMPLETE SURPRISE—CARELESS
OFFICERS—HEROIC DEFENCE—BEGINNING OF A
LONG IMPRISONMENT.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Belle Island</span>, Richmond, Va., Nov. 22, 1863.—I was captured
near Rogersville, East Tennessee, on the 6th of this month, while
acting as Brigade Quarter-Master Sergt. The Brigade was divided,
two regiments twenty miles away, while Brigade Head-Quarters
with 7th Ohio and 1st Tennessee Mounted Infantry were at Rogersville.
The brigade quarter-master had a large quantity of clothing
on hand, which we were about to issue to the brigade as soon
as possible. The rebel citizens got up a dance at one of the public
houses in the village, and invited all the union officers. This was
the evening of Nov. 5th. Nearly all the officers attended and
were away from the command nearly all night and many were
away all night. We were encamped in a bend of the Holston
River. It was a dark rainy night and the river rose rapidly before
morning. The dance was a ruse to get our officers away from their
command. At break of day the pickets were drove in by rebel
cavalry, and orders were immediately received from commanding
officer to get wagon train out on the road in ten minutes. The
quarter-master had been to the dance and had not returned, consequently
it devolved upon me to see to wagon train, which I did,
and in probably ten minutes the whole seventy six mule army wagons
were in line out on the main road, while the companies were
forming into line and getting ready for a fight. Rebels had us
completely surrounded and soon began to fire volley after volley
into our disorganized ranks. Not one officer in five was present;
Gen. commanding and staff as soon as they realized our danger,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
started for the river, swam across and got away. We had a small
company of artillery with us commanded by a lieutenant. The
lieutenant in the absence of other officers, assumed command of
the two regiments, and right gallantly did he do service. Kept
forming his men for the better protection of his wagon train, while
the rebels were shifting around from one point to another, and all
the time sending volley after volley into our ranks. Our men did
well, and had there been plenty of officers and ammunition, we
might have gained the day. After ten hours fighting we were
obliged to surrender after having lost in killed over a hundred, and
three or four times that number in wounded. After surrendering
we were drawn up into line, counted off and hurriedly marched
away south. By eight o’clock at night had probably marched ten
miles, and encamped until morning. We expected that our troops
would intercept and release us, but they did not. An hour before
daylight we were up and on the march toward Bristol, Va., that
being the nearest railroad station. We were cavalrymen, and
marching on foot made us very lame, and we could hardly hobble
along. Were very well fed on corn bread and bacon. Reached
Bristol, Va., Nov. 8th and were soon aboard of cattle cars en-route
for the rebel capital. I must here tell how I came into possession
of a very nice and large bed spread which is doing good service
even now these cold nights. After we were captured everything
was taken away from us, blankets, overcoats, and in many cases
our boots and shoes. I had on a new pair of boots, which by muddying
them over had escaped the rebel eyes thus far, as being a
good pair. As our blankets had been taken away from us we suffered
considerably from cold. I saw that if I was going to remain
a prisoner of war it behooved me to get hold of a blanket. After a
few hours march I became so lame walking with my new boots on
that the rebels were compelled to put me on an old horse that was
being lead along by one of the guard. This guard had the bed
spread before spoken of. Told him I was going into prison at the
beginning of a long winter, and should need a blanket, and couldn’t
he give me his. We had considerable talk, and were very good
friends. Said he rather liked me but wouldn’t part with his bed
spread. Didn’t love me that much, treated me however with apple
jack out of his canteen. I kept getting my wits together to arrange
some plan to get the article in question. Finally told him I had a
large sum of money on my person which I expected would be
taken away from me anyway, and as he was a good fellow would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
rather he would have it than any one else. He was delighted and
all attention, wanted me to be careful and not let any of the other
rebels see the transfer. I had a lot of Michigan broken down wild
cat money, and pulled it out of an inside pocket and handed him
the roll. It was green paper and of course he supposed it greenbacks.
Was very glad of the gift and wanted to know what he
could do for me. My first proposition to him was to let me escape,
but he couldn’t do that, then I told him to give me the bed spread,
as it might save my life. After some further parley, he consented
and handed over the spread. He was afraid to look at his money
for fear some one would see him, and so did not discover that
it was worthless until we had become separated. Guards were
changed that night and never saw him any more.</p>

<p>The cars ran very slow, and being crowded for room the journey
to Richmond was very tedious. Arrived on the morning of Nov.
13th, seven days after capture, at the south end of the “long
bridge,” ordered out of the cars and into line, counted off and
started for Belle Isle. Said island is in the James River, probably
covers ten or twelve acres, and is right across from Richmond.
The river between Richmond and the island is probably a third or
half a mile. The “long bridge” is near the lower part of the island.
It is a cold, bleak piece of ground and the winter winds have
free sweep from up the river. Before noon we were turned into
the pen which is merely enclosed by a ditch and the dirt taken from
the ditch thrown up on the outside, making a sort of breastwork.
The ditch serves as a dead line, and no prisoners must go near the
ditch. The prison is in command of a Lieut. Bossieux, a rather
young and gallant looking sort of fellow. Is a born Southerner,
talking so much like a negro that you would think he was one, if
you could hear him talk and not see him. He has two rebel sergeants
to act as his assistants, Sergt. Hight and Sergt. Marks.
These two men are very cruel, as is also the Lieut. when angered.
Outside the prison pen is a bake house, made of boards, the rebel
tents for the accommodation of the officers and guard, and a hospital
also of tent cloth. Running from the pen is a lane enclosed
by high boards going to the water’s edge. At night this is closed
up by a gate at the pen, and thrown open in the morning. About
half of the six thousand prisoners here have tents while the rest
sleep and live out of doors. After I had been on this island two or
three days, I was standing near the gate eating some rice soup out
of an old broken bottle, thoroughly disgusted with the Southern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Confederacy, and this prison in particular. A young man came up
to me whom I immediately recognized as George W. Hendryx, a
member of my own company “A” 9th Mich. Cavalry, who had
been captured some time before myself. Was feeling so blue, cross
and cold that I didn’t care whether it was him or not. He was on
his way to the river to get some water. Found I wasn’t going to
notice him in any way, and so proceeded on his errand. When I
say that George Hendryx was one of the most valued friends I had
in the regiment, this action on my part will seem strange as indeed
it is. Did not want to see him or any one else I had ever seen
before. Well, George came back a few moments after, looked at
me a short time and says: “I believe you are John L. Ransom, Q.
M. Sergt. of the same Co. with me, although you don’t seem to
recognize me.” Told him “I was that same person, recognized
him and there could be no mistake about it.” Wanted to know
why in the old harry I didn’t speak to him then. After telling him
just how it was, freezing to death, half starved and gray backs
crawling all over me, &amp;c., we settled down into being glad to see
one another.</p>

<p>Nov 23.—Having a few dollars of good yankee money which I
have hoarded since my capture, have purchased a large blank book
and intend as long as I am a prisoner of war in this confederacy,
to note down from day to day as occasion may occur, events as
they happen, treatment, ups and downs generally. It will serve to
pass away the time and may be interesting at some future time to
read over.</p>

<p>Nov. 24.—Very cold weather. Four or five men chilled to
death last night. A large portion of the prisoners who have been
in confinement any length of time are reduced to almost skeletons
from continued hunger, exposure and filth. Having some money
just indulged in an extra ration of corn bread for which I paid
twenty cents in yankee script, equal to two dollars confederate
money, and should say by the crowd collected around that such a
sight was an unusual occurrence, and put me in mind of gatherings
I have seen at the north around some curiosity. We received for
to-day’s food half a pint of rice soup and one-quarter of a pound
loaf of corn bread. The bread is made from the very poorest meal,
coarse, sour and musty; would make poor feed for swine at home.
The rice is nothing more than boiled in river water with no seasoning
whatever, not even salt, but for all that it tasted nice. The
greatest difficulty is the small allowance given us. The prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
are blue, downcast and talk continually of home and something
good to eat. They nearly all think there will be an exchange of
prisoners before long and the trick of it is to live until the time
approaches. We are divided off into hundreds with a sergeant to
each squad who draws the food and divides it up among his men,
and woe unto him if a man is wronged out of his share—his life is
not worth the snap of the finger if caught cheating. No wood to-night
and it is very cold. The nights are long and are made hideous
by the moans of suffering wretches.</p>

<p>Nov. 25.—Hendryx is in a very good tent with some nine or ten
others and is now trying to get me into the already crowded shelter.
They say I can have the first vacancy and as it is impossible
for a dozen to remain together long without losing some by sickness,
my chances will be good in a few days at fartherest. Food
again at four o’clock. In place of soup received about four ounces
of salt horse, as we call it.</p>

<p>Nov. 26.—Hendryx sacrificed his own comfort and lay out doors
with me last night and I got along much better than the night
before. Are getting food twice to-day; old prisoners say it is fully
a third more than they have been getting. Hardly understand how
we could live on much less. A Michigan man (could not learn
his name) while at work a few moments ago on the outside with a
squad of detailed yankees repairing a part of the embankment
which recent rains had washed away, stepped upon the wall to give
orders to his men when one of the guards shot him through the
head, killing him instantly. Lieut. Bossieux, commander of the
prison, having heard the shot, came to learn the cause. He told
the guard he ought to be more careful and not shoot those who
were on parole and doing fatigue duty, and ordered the body carried
to the dead-house. Seems tough to me but others don’t seem
to mind it much. I am mad.</p>

<p>Nov. 27.—Stormy and disagreeable weather. From fifteen to
twenty and twenty-five die every day and are buried just outside
the prison with no coffins—nothing but canvas wrapped around
them. Eight sticks of four foot wood given every squad of one
hundred men to-day, and when split up and divided it amounted to
nothing towards warming a person. Two or three can put their
wood together and boil a little coffee made from bread crusts. The
sick are taken out every morning and either sent over to the city or
kept in the hospital just outside the prison and on the island.
None admitted unless carried out in blankets and so far gone there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
is not much chance of recovery. Medical attendance is scarce.</p>

<p>Nov. 28.—Very cold and men suffer terribly with hardly any
clothing on some of them. A man taken outside to-day, bucked
and gagged for talking with a guard; a severe punishment this very
cold weather.</p>

<p>Nov. 30.—Came across E. P. Sanders, from Lansing, Michigan,
and a jolly old soul is he. Can’t get discouraged where he is. Talk
a great deal about making our escape but there is not much prospect.
We are very strongly guarded with artillery bearing on every
part of the prison. The long bridge I have heard so much about
crosses the river just below the island. It is very long and has
been condemned for years—trains move very slow across it. There
was a big fire over in Richmond last night about 2 o’clock; could
hear all the fire bells and see the house tops covered with people
looking at it. Great excitement among the Johnny Rebs.</p>

<p>Dec. 1.—With no news concerning the great subject—exchange
of prisoners. Very hungry and am not having a good time of it.
Take it all around I begin to wish I had stayed at home and was
at the <cite>Jackson Citizen</cite> office pulling the old press. Dream continually
nights about something good to eat; seems rather hard such
plenty at the North and starving here. Have just seen a big fight
among the prisoners; just like so many snarly dogs, cross and
peevish. A great deal of fighting going on. Rebels collect around
on the outside in crowds to see the Yankees bruise themselves and
it is quite sport for them. Have succeeded in getting into the tent
with Hendryx. One of the mess has been sent over to Richmond
Hospital leaving a vacancy which I am to fill. There are nine
others, myself making ten. The names are as follows: W. C. Robinson,
orderly sergeant, 34th Illinois; W. H. Mustard, hospital
steward 100th Pennsylvania; Joe Myers, 34th Illinois; H. Freeman,
hospital steward 30th Ohio; C. G. Strong, 4th Ohio cavalry; Corporal
John McCarten, 6th Kentucky; U. Kindred, 1st East Tennessee
infantry; E. P. Sanders, 20th Michigan infantry; George Hendryx
and myself of the 9th Michigan cavalry. A very good crowd
of boys, and all try to make their places as pleasant as possible.
Gen. Neil Dow to-day came over from Libby Prison on parole of
honor to help issue some clothing that has arrived for Belle Isle
prisoners from the Sanitary Commission at the North. Sergeant
Robinson taken outside to help Gen. Dow in issuing clothing and
thinks through his influence to get more out for the same purpose.
A man froze to death last night where I slept. The body lay until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
nearly dark before it was removed. My blanket comes in good
play, and it made the boys laugh when I told how I got it. We
tell stories, dance around, keep as clean as we can without soap
and make the best of a very bad situation.</p>

<p>Dec. 2.—Pleasant weather and favorable for prisoners. At
about nine in the morning the work of hunting for vermin commences,
and all over camp sit the poor starved wretches, nearly
stripped, engaged in picking off and killing the big gray backs.
The ground is fairly alive with them, and it requires continual
labor to keep from being eaten up alive by them. I just saw a man
shot. He was called down to the bank by the guard, and as he
leaned over to do some trading another guard close by shot him
through the side and it is said mortally wounded him. It was
made up between the guards to shoot the man, and when the lieutenant
came round to make inquiries concerning the affair, one of
them remarked that the —— passed a counterfeit bill on
him the night before, and he thought he would put him where he
could not do the like again. The wounded man was taken to the
hospital and has since died. His name was Gilbert. He was from
New Jersey. Food twice to-day; buggy bean soup and a very
small allowance of corn bread. Hungry all the time.</p>

<p>Dec. 3.—Rumors of exchange to be effected soon. Rebels say
we will all be exchanged before many days. It cannot be possible
our government will allow us to remain here all winter. Gen. Dow
is still issuing clothing, but the rebels get more than our men do of
it. Guards nearly all dressed in Yankee uniforms. In our mess
we have established regulations, and any one not conforming with
the rules is to be turned out of the tent. Must take plenty of exercise,
keep clean, free as circumstances will permit of vermin, drink
no water until it has been boiled, which process purifies and makes
it more healthy, are not to allow ourselves to get despondent, and
must talk, laugh and make as light of our affairs as possible. Sure
death for a person to give up and lose all ambition. Received a
spoonful of salt to-day for the first time since I came here.</p>

<p>Dec. 4.—Exchange news below par to-day. Rather colder than
yesterday; a great many sick and dying off rapidly. Rebel guards
are more strict than usual, and one risks his life by speaking to
them at all. Wrote a letter home to-day, also one to a friend in
Washington. Doubtful whether I ever hear from them. Robinson
comes inside every night and always brings something good.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
We look forward to the time of his coming with pleasure. Occasionally
he brings a stick of wood which we split up fine and build
a cheerful fire in our little sod fireplace, sit up close together and
talk of home and friends so far away. We call our establishment
the “Astor House of Belle Isle.” There are so many worse off
than we are that we are very well contented and enjoy ourselves
after a fashion.</p>

<p>Dec. 5.—Cold and raw weather with no wood. Men are too
weak to walk nights to keep warm, sink down and chill to death.
At least a dozen were carried out this morning feet foremost.
Through Robinson’s influence Hendryx and myself will go out to-morrow
to issue clothing, and will come in nights to sleep. We
are to receive extra rations for our services. In good spirits to-night
with a good fire and very comfortable for this place.</p>

<p>Dec. 6.—One month a prisoner to-day—longer than any year of
my life before. Hope I am not to see another month in the Confederacy.
A great deal of stealing going on among the men.
There are organized bands of raiders who do pretty much as they
please. A ration of bread is often of more consequence than a
man’s life. Have received food but once to-day; very cold; at
least one hundred men limping around with frozen feet, and some
of them crying like little children. Am at work on the outside
to-day; go out at nine in the morning and return at four in the
afternoon, and by right smart figuring carry in much extra food for
tent mates, enough to give all hands a good square meal.</p>

<p>Dec. 7.—No news of importance. The rebels say a flag of truce
boat has arrived at City Point and Commissioner Olds telegraphed
for and undoubtedly will agree upon terms for an exchange of prisoners.
Men receiving boxes from their friends at the north and am
writing for one myself without much hope of ever getting it.</p>

<p>Dec. 8.—The men all turned out of the enclosure and are being
squadded over. A very stormy and cold day; called out before
breakfast and nearly dark before again sent inside. Very muddy
and the men have suffered terribly, stand up all day in the cold
drizzling rain, with no chance for exercise and many barefooted.
I counted nine or ten who went out in the morning not able to get
back at night; three of the number being dead.</p>

<p>Dec 9.—Rumors that one thousand go off to-day to our lines and
the same number every day until all are removed. It was not believed
until a few moments ago the Lieutenant stepped upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
bank and said that in less than a week we would all be home again,
and such a cheering among us; every man who could yell had his
mouth stretched. Persons who fifteen minutes ago could not rise
to their feet are jumping around in excitement, shaking hands with
one another and crying, “A general exchange! a general exchange!”
All in good spirits and we talk of the good dinners we will get on
the road home. Food twice to-day and a little salt.</p>

<p>Dec. 10.—Instead of prisoners going away five hundred more
have come, which makes it very crowded. Some are still confident
we will go away soon, but I place no reliance on rebel reports.
Rather warmer than usual, and the men busying themselves hunting
vermin. A priest in the camp distributing tracts. Men told him
to bring bread; they want no tracts. Exchange news has died
away, and more despondent than ever. I to-day got hold of a Richmond
<cite>Enquirer</cite> which spoke of bread riots in the city, women running
around the streets and yelling, “Peace or bread!”</p>

<p>Dec. 11.—Was on guard last night over the clothing outside.
Lieut. Bossieux asked Corp. McCarten and myself to eat supper
with him last night, which we were very glad to do. Henry, the
negro servant, said to the lieutenant after we had got through eating:
“I golly, masser, don’t nebber ask dem boys to eat with us
again, dey eat us out clean gone;” and so we did eat everything on
the table and looked for more.</p>

<p>Dec. 12.—At just daylight I got up and was walking around the
prison to see if any Michigan men had died through the night, and
was just in time to see a young fellow come out of his tent nearly
naked and deliberately walk up the steps that lead over the bank.
Just as he got on the top the guard fired; sending a ball through his
brain, and the poor fellow fell dead in the ditch. I went and got
permission to help pull him out. He had been sick for a number
of days and was burning up with fever, and no doubt deranged at
the time, else he would have known better than to have risked his
life in such a manner. His name was Perry McMichael, and he
was from Minnesota. Perhaps he is better off, and a much easier
death than to die of disease as he undoubtedly would in a few days,
longer. The work of issuing clothing slowly goes on. In place of
Gen. Dow, Col. Sanderson comes over on parole of honor; and is
not liked at all. Is of New York and a perfect tyrant; treats us as
bad or worse than the rebels themselves. Col. Boyd also comes
occasionally and is a perfect gentleman. Talked to me to-day concerning
Sanderson’s movements, and said if he got through to our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
lines should complain of him to the authorities at Washington. He
took down notes in his diary against him.</p>

<p>Dec. 13.—Nothing of any importance to note down. The officers
come over from Richmond every day or two, and make a showing
of issuing clothing. The work goes on slowly, and it would
seem that if clothing was ever needed and ought to be issued, it is
now; yet the officers seem to want to nurse the job and make it last
as long as possible. Many cruelties are practiced, principally by
the rebel sergeants. The lieutenant does not countenance much
cruelty, still he is very quick tempered, and when provoked is apt
to do some very severe things. The Yankees are a hard crowd to
manage; will steal anything, no matter what, regardless of consequences.
Still I don’t know as it is any wonder, cooped up as they
are in such a place, and called upon to endure such privations.
The death rate gradually increases from day to day. A little Cincinnati
soldier died to-day. Was captured same time as myself,
and we had messed together a number of times before I became
identified with the “Astor House Mess.” Was in very poor health
when captured, but could never quite find out what ailed him. I
have many talks with the rebels, and am quite a priveleged character.
By so doing am able to do much for the boys inside, and there
are good boys in there, whom I would do as much for as myself.</p>

<p>Dec. 17.—I have plenty to eat. Go outside every day whether
clothing is issued or not. To explain the manner of issuing clothing:
The men are called outside by squads, that is, one squad of a
hundred men at a time; all stand in a row in front of the boxes of
clothing. The officer in charge, Col. Sanderson, begins with the
first at the head of the column, looks him over, and says to us
paroled men: “Here, give this man a pair of pants,” or coat, or such
clothing as he may stand in need of. In this way he gets through
with a hundred men in about half an hour. Us boys often manage
to give three or four articles where only one has been ordered.
There seems to be plenty of clothing here, and we can see no reason
why it should not be given away. Have to be very careful,
though, for if we are caught at these tricks are sent inside to stay.
Officers stay on the island only two or three hours, and clothe four
or five hundred men, when they could just as well do three or four
times as much. It is comical the notes that come in some of the good
warm woolen stockings. These have evidently been knit by the
good mothers, wives and sisters at the North, and some of the
romantic sort have written letters and placed inside, asking the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
receiver to let them know about himself, his name, etc., etc. Most
of them come from the New England states, and they cheer the
boys up a great deal.</p>

<p>Dec. 18.—To-day as a squad was drawn up in front of us, waiting
for clothing, I saw an Irishman in the ranks who looked familiar.
Looked at him for some time and finally thought I recognized
in him an old neighbor of mine in Jackson Michigan; one
Jimmy Devers, a whole souled and comical genius as ever it was
my fortune to meet. Went up to him and asked what regiment he
belonged to; said he belonged to the 23d Indiana, at which I could
not believe it was my old acquaintance. Went back to my work.
Pretty soon he said to me: “Ain’t you Johnny Ransom?” And
then I knew I was right. He had lived in Jackson, but had enlisted
in an Indiana regiment. Well, we were glad to see one another and
you may just bet that Jimmy got as good a suit of clothes as ever
he had in our own lines. Jimmy is a case; was captured on the 1st
day of July at the Gettysburg battle, and is consequently an old
prisoner. Is very tough and hardy. Says the Johnny Rebs have
a big contract on their hands to kill him. But I tell him to take
good care of himself anyway, as there is no knowing what he will
be called upon to pass through yet.</p>

<p>Dec. 20.—James River frozen nearly over, and rebels say it has
not been so cold for years as at the present time. There are hundreds
with frozen feet, ears, hands &amp;c., and laying all over the
prison; and the suffering is terrible. Hendryx and myself are
intent on some plan for escape. The lieutenant has spies who are
on the watch. The authorities know all about any conspiracy
almost as soon as it is known among ourselves. Last night just
after dark two or three Yankees agreed to give the guard $10 if he
would let them get over the bank, to which he promised; and as
soon as they got nearly over fired and immediately gave the alarm.
One of them received a shot in one of his legs and the others scrambled
back over the bank; the three minus their $10 bill and a sound
leg. They cannot be trusted at all and will promise anything for
greenbacks. Sergt. Bullock of our regiment is here and very
sick with fever; cannot possibly live many weeks in such a place
as this. Col. Sanderson still issuing clothing, but very unfair, and
the men who need it most get none at all. All the outsiders
received a suit throughout to-day, myself among the rest. Got a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
letter from home, everybody is well. They say keep up good heart
and we will be exchanged before many weeks.</p>

<p>Dec. 21.—Still cold. Have enough to eat myself, but am one of
a thousand. The scurvy is appearing among some of the men, and
is an awful disease—caused by want of vegetable diet, acids, &amp;c.
Two small-pox cases taken to the hospital to-day. A sutler has
been established on the island and sells at the following rates: poor
brown sugar, $8 per pound; butter, $11; cheese, $10; sour milk $3
per quart and the only article I buy; eggs, $10 per dozen; oysters,
$6 per quart and the cheapest food in market.</p>

<p>Dec. 22.—A large mail came this morning, but nothing for me.
A man who gets a letter is besieged with questions, and a crowd
gathers around to learn the news, if any, regarding our future.
Rations smaller than usual, and Lieut. Bossieux says that it is
either exchange or starve with us prisoners sure, as they have not
the food to give us. To-day saw a copy of the Richmond Enquirer
in which was a long article treating on exchange of prisoners,
saying our government would not exchange owing to an excess
held by us, and unless their terms were agreed to, as they could not
afford to keep us, the coming summer would reduce our ranks so
that they would not have many to feed another winter. Rather
poor prospects ahead for us poor imprisoned yanks. Lots of Sanitary
stores sent on to the island for us, but as yet none have been
issued, the rebels (officers in particular), getting fat on what rightfully
belongs to us.</p>

<p>Dec. 23.—Almost Christmas and we are planning for a Christmas
dinner. Very cold. The rebels are testing their big guns on the
opposite shore of the river and fairly shake the ground we stand
on. We can see the shells as they leave the guns until they
explode, affording quite a pastime for us watching their war
machines. Militia in sight drilling over in Richmond. A woman
found among us—a prisoner of war. Some one who knew the
secret informed Lieutenant Bossieux and he immediately had her
taken outside, when she told him the whole story—how she had
“followed her lovyer a soldiering” in disguise, and being of a
romantic turn, enjoyed it hugely until the funny part was done
away with and Madame Collier, from East Tennessee, found herself
in durance vile; nothing to do but make the best of it and
conceal her sex if possible, hoping for a release, which, however,
did not come in the shape she wished. The lieutenant has sent her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
over to Richmond to be cared for and she is to be sent north by the
first flag of truce boat. She tells of another female being among us,
but as yet she has not been found out.</p>

<p>Dec. 24.—Must hang up my stocking to-night for habit’s sake if
nothing else. I am enjoying splendid health, and prison life agrees
with me. Wrote home to-day.</p>

<p>Dec. 25—and Christmas.—One year ago to-day first went into
camp at Coldwater, little dreaming what changes a year would
bring around, but there are exchange rumors afloat and hope to
see white folks again before many months. All ordered out to be
squadded over again, which was quite a disappointment to our mess
as we were making preparations for a grand dinner, gotten up by
outside hands, Mustard, Myers, Hendryx and myself. However,
we had our good things for supper instead of dinner, and it was a
big thing, consisting of corn bread and butter, oysters, coffee, beef,
crackers, cheese &amp;c.; all we could possibly eat or do away with, and
costing the snug little sum of $200 Confederate money, or $20 in
greenbacks. Lay awake long before daylight listening to the bells.
As they rang out Christmas good morning I imagined they were in
Jackson, Michigan, my old home, and from the spires of the old
Presbyterian and Episcopal churches. Little do they think as they
are saying their Merry Christmases and enjoying themselves so
much, of the hunger and starving here. But there are better days
coming.</p>

<p>Dec. 26.—News of exchange and no officers over from Libby to
issue clothing. Extra quantity of wood. Rebels all drunk and
very domineering. Punish for the smallest kind of excuse. Some
men tunneled out of the pen but were retaken and were made to
crawl back through the same hole they went out of and the lieutenant
kept hitting them with a board as they went down and then ran
back and forward from one hole to the other and as they stuck up
their heads would hit them with a club, keeping them at it for
nearly an hour. A large crowd of both rebels and Yankees collected
around to see the fun.</p>

<p>Dec. 27.—Col. Sanderson and Col. Boyd came over this morning
in a great hurry and began to issue clothing very fast saying an exchange
had been agreed upon and they wanted to get rid of it before
we all went away. Pretty soon the news got inside and the greatest
cheering, yelling, shaking of hands and congratulating one another
took place. Just before dinner five hundred were taken out,
counted and sent away. Everybody anxious to go away first which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of course they cannot do. Sergts. Hight and Marks stand at the
gate with big clubs keeping order, letting them out two at a time,
occasionally knocking a man down and it is seldom he gets up
again very soon. Some of the outside went and the rest go to-morrow.
It is a sure thing—a general exchange and all will be sent
away immediately. Everybody in good spirits. Guess northern
folks will be surprised to see such looking objects come among
them. They are the worst looking crowd I ever saw. Extra ration
of food and wood to-night and am anxiously waiting for the morrow.</p>

<p>Dec. 28.—For some reason or other no more being taken away
and more despondent than ever. Very cold.</p>

<p>Dec. 29.—Nearly as cold weather as I ever saw at the North. All
the supplies brought by hand over the long bridge, owing to the
river being frozen over and not strong enough to hold up. Rebel
officers all drunk during the holidays. Snow an inch deep.</p>

<p>Dec. 30.—No rations issued yesterday to any of the prisoners and
a third of all here are on the very point of starvation. Lieut. Bossieux
sympathizes with us in word but says it is impossible to help
it as they have not the food for us. This is perhaps true as regards
edibles but there is no excuse for our receiving such small supplies
of wood. They could give us plenty of shelter, plenty of wood and
conveniences we do not now get if they felt so disposed.</p>

<p>Dec. 31.—Still very cold and no news encouraging. Rebels very
strict. One prisoner found a brother among the guards who had
been living in the south for a good many years and lately conscripted
into the Confederate army. New Year’s eve. Man wounded by
the guard shooting, and ball broke his leg. Might better have shot
him dead for he will surely die. Raw rice and corn bread issued
to-day in small quantities. Richmond <cite>Enquirer</cite> spoke of the five
hundred who left here day before yesterday and they have reached
Washington.</p>

<p>Jan. 1, 1864.—A great time this morning wishing one another a
Happy New Year. Robinson bought on the outside a dozen apples
and gave us all a treat. Nothing but corn bread to eat and very
poor quality. Dr. F. L. Lewis, Vet. Surg. 9th Mich. cavalry, came
in to-day; was captured at Dandridge, East Tennessee, where our
regiment had a severe engagement. Tells me all the news. Col.
Acker wounded, etc., etc. Thinks it a queer New Year trip, but
also thinks we will be exchanged before many weeks.</p>

<p>Jan. 2.—Rebel congress about to meet, and the people of Richmond
demand through the papers that the prisoners confined here
be removed immediately, as there is hardly enough for themselves
to eat, aside from feeding us “Northern Hirelings.” Hear of bread
riots and lots of trouble across the river. A big fire last night in
the vicinity of Libby Prison.</p>

<p>Jan. 3.—Received a letter from Michigan. Not quite so cold,
but disagreeable weather. Nine men bucked and gagged at one
time on the outside, two of them for stealing sour beans from a
swill-barrel. They would get permission to pass through the gate
to see the lieutenant, and instead, would walk around the cook-house
to some barrels containing swill, scoop up their hats full and
then run inside; but they were caught, and are suffering a hard
punishment for it.</p>

<p>Jan. 4.—Some ladies visited the island to see us blue coats, and
laughed very much at our condition; thought it so comical and
ludicrous the way the prisoners crowded the bank next the cook-house,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
looking over at the piles of bread, and compared us to wild
men, and hungry dogs. A chicken belonging to the lieutenant flew
up on the bank and was snatched off in short order, and to pay for
it we are not to receive a mouthful of food to-day, making five or
six thousand suffer for one man catching a little chicken.</p>

<p>Jan. 5.—Succeeded in getting Dr. Lewis into our tent; is rather
under the weather, owing to exposure and hardship. Jimmy Devers
spends the evenings with us and we have funny times talking
over better days—and are nearly talked out. I have said all I can
think, and am just beginning to talk it all over again. All our
stories have been told from two, to three or four times, and are getting
stale. We offer a reward for a good new story.</p>

<p>Jan. 6.—Still prisoners of war, without the remotest idea as to
how long we are to remain so. Some of the paroled Yankees on
the outside curse and treat the inside prisoners more cruel (when
they have a chance,) than the rebels themselves. Blass, a Spaniard,
who has been a prisoner over a year and refuses to be exchanged,
is the lieutenant’s right hand man. He tied up a man a few days
ago for some misdemeanor and whipped him. He is afraid to come
inside, knowing he would lose his life in a jiffy. He also raises
the rebel flag at the island mornings, and lowers it at night. It is
a dirty rag, and the appearance of it ought to disgust any sensible
person.</p>

<p>Jan. 7.—Rainy, cold and disagreeable weather. Henry Stilson,
a fellow who was captured with me, was carried out dead this
morning. He was diseased when taken, and fell an easy prey to
their cruelties. A good deal of raiding is going on among the men.
One Captain Moseby commands a band of cut-throats who do nearly
as they please, cheating, robbing and knocking down—operating
principally upon new prisoners who are unacquainted with prison
life. Moseby is named after the rebel guerrilla, his real name being
something else. He is from New York City, and is a regular bummer.</p>

<p>Jan. 8.—All taken outside to-day to be squadded over—an all
day job, and nothing to eat. The men being in hundreds and some
dying off every day, leave vacancies in the squads of as many as
die out of them, and in order to keep them filled up have to be
squadded over every few days, thereby saving rations. Richmond
papers are much alarmed for fear of a break among the prisoners
confined within the city. It is said there are six hundred muskets
secreted among the Belle Islanders. The citizens are frightened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
almost to death, double guards are placed over us, and very strict
orders issued to them.</p>

<p>Jan. 9.—A signal light suspended over the island all last night
for some reason unknown to the men confined here. We are cautioned
against approaching within eight or ten feet from the bank.
One of the raiders went through a man who lay near the bank and
started to run after robbing him. A guard who saw the whole
affair shot the villain dead and was applauded by all who knew of
the affair. Fifteen or twenty carried out this morning dead and
thirty or forty nearly so in blankets.</p>

<p>Jan. 10.—A brass band over to-day giving us a tune. Looks more
like a wandering tribe of vagabonds than musicians. Discoursed
sweet music, such as “Bonnie Blue Flag,” “The Girl I Left Behind
Me,” and for their pains got three groans from their enemies in
limbo. Dying off very fast on the island.</p>

<p>Jan. 11.—A steady rain for twenty-four hours, and have not been
dry during the time. However it is a warm rain and get along very
well. We are still issuing clothing but very slow. About one hundred
per day get partly clothed up. No news of exchange. Abe
Lincoln reported dead. Papers very bitter on Beast Butler, as they
call him. Manage by a good deal of skirmishing to get the papers
almost every day in which we read their rebel lies. A plan afoot
for escape, but am afraid to say anything of the particulars for fear
of my diary being taken away from me. As I came inside to-night
with some bread in my haversack some fellows who were on the
watch pitched into me and gobbled my saved up rations. I don’t
care for myself for I have been to supper, but the boys in the tent
will have to go without anything to eat for this night. It don’t
matter much—they are all hungry and it did them as much good as
it would our mess.</p>

<p>Jan. 12.—James River very high. A continual roar in our ears
caused by the water falling over the cataract just above the island.
Rebels fired a large shell over the prison to scare us.</p>

<p>Jan. 15.—Everything runs along about the same. Little excitements
from day to day. The weather is fair, and taken all together
thus far this winter has been very favorable to us as prisoners.
Lieut. Bossieux lost his dog. Some Yanks snatched him into a
tent and eat him up. Bossieux very mad and is anxious to know who
the guilty ones are. All he can do is to keep all our rations from
us one day, and he does it. Seems pretty rough when a man will
eat a dog, but such is the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>Jan. 18.—Too much exertion to even write in my diary. Talk of
getting away by escaping, but find no feasible plan. Rebs very
watchful. Some mail to-day but nothing for me. Saw some
papers, and a new prisoner brought with him a New York paper,
but not a word in it about “exchange.” Am still outside most every
day. Geo. Hendryx at work in the cook-house cooking rations for
the prisoners. Comes down where I am every day and hands me
something to take inside for the boys. He tells the Lieut. he has a
brother inside that he is feeding. Although it is against orders,
Lieut. Bossieux pays no attention to it.</p>

<p>Jan. 20.—Rebel officers over to-day inspecting us Yanks. Some
of the worst looking Arabs in shape of officers I ever saw. Jimmy
Devers comes to our tent every night and sits with us until bed
time. Is a jolly chap and keeps us all in good spirits with his
sayings. Sergt. Robinson, I learned to-day, instead of being a sergeant
is a lieutenant. His whole company being captured, he preferred
to go with them and share their trials, than go with the officers.
The men are very much attached to him and no wonder, as
he is a fine fellow. His home is in Sterling, Whiteside Co., Illinois.
Corp. McCartin is, as his name would indicate, an Irishman,
and his home is Louisville, Ky. Is a shoemaker by trade. He is
also a Mason, and I am going to write down wherein the fact of his
being a Mason has brought good into the camp to-day. The boys
feeling rather more hungry than usual were rather despondent, when
the corporal gets up and says: “Boys, I’ll go and get something to
eat.” Went out of the tent and in twenty minutes came back with
three or four pounds of bacon and two loaves of corn bread. We
were surprised and asked how he had performed the miracle. Told
us then that he was a Mason, as also was the lieutenant in charge,
from whom the food came. We decided then and there that the
first opportunity that presented itself we would join the Masons.
Can see the rebels drilling across the river.</p>

<p>Jan. 22.—Cold and clear weather. Nothing to write to-day. It’s
a task.</p>

<p>Jan. 24.—We are all troubled with heart-burn, sour stomach,
&amp;c. Drink weak lye made from ashes for it. Every day some new
ones come inside, but they know nothing as to the prospects of our
being exchanged. All are considerably surprised to find themselves
in quite so bad a place, and the subject of prison life begins to
interest them. Good deal of gambling going on among prisoners.
Chuck-a-luck is the favorite game. You lay your ration of bread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
down on a figure on a board, and a fellow with a dice-box shakes it
up a little, throws out the dice, and your bread is gone. Don’t
understand the game myself. That’s all I ever saw of the game.
Lay down the bread and it’s gone. Rather a one sided affair.
Some men are very filthy, which makes it disagreeable for those of
more cleanly habits. I believe that many, very many, who now
die, would live if they adopted the rules that our mess has, and
lived up to them. It is the only way to get along.</p>

<p>Jan. 25.—Being in this place brings out a man for just what he
is worth. Those whom we expect the most from in the way of
braving hardships and dangers, prove to be nobody at all. And
very often those whom we expect the least from prove to be heroes
every inch of them. Notably one of these is George Hendryx,
who is nothing but a good looking, effeminate boy, fit, you would
say, to be going to school with a mother to look after him, and for
not much else. But instead, he is brave, cheerful, smart, watching
every chance to get the best of the Johnny Rebs. His position
in the cook-house has given him a chance to feed, I presume, hundreds
of men. Near the cook-house is a store-house, and in it are
several hogsheads of hams. These hams were sent from the Sanitary
Commission at the North for Union prisoners, but they for
whom they were intended do not get them, and they are being eaten
up by the rebels. Hendryx has managed to get up a board in the
cook-house floor, where he can crawl fifteen or twenty feet under
the store-house and up through that floor. By this Yankee trick
he has stolen, I presume one hundred hams and gotten them inside
where they belong. This is very risky on his part, for should he
be discovered it would go very hard with him. He is about as
unselfish a fellow as you can well find. This is only one of his
plans to outwit the rebels for our benefit. His head is all the time,
too, planning some way of escape. Well, we all hope he won’t get
caught. All shake in our boots for him. Was on guard last night,
outside, over the clothing. There is so much clothing stole by the
rebels that Bossieux put a guard of two over the boxes through
the night, and if any of the Rebs. come around to steal we are
instructed to wake up the lieutenant, who sleeps near by in a tent.
I was on duty last night with Joe Myers, and Hendryx came where
we were and unfolded a plan for escape which he has been working
up. It is a risky affair, and had best be thought over pretty
thorough before put into execution. Robinson has been found out
as a lieutenant, and taken over to Richmond to be placed with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
officers in Libby Prison. We are sorry that we must lose him.</p>

<p>Jan. 26.—Ninety-two squads of prisoners confined on less than
six acres of ground—one hundred in a squad, making nine thousand
and two hundred altogether. The lice are getting the upper
hand of us. The ground is literally covered with them. Bean soup
to-day and is made from the following recipe, (don’t know from
what cook book, some new edition): Beans are very wormy and
musty. Hard work finding a bean without from one to three bugs
in it. They are put into a large caldron kettle of river water and
boiled for a couple of hours. No seasoning, not even salt put into
them. It is then taken out and brought inside. Six pails full for
each squad—about a pint per man, and not over a pint of beans in
each bucket. The water is hardly colored and I could see clear
through to the bottom and count every bean in the pail. The men
drink it because it is warm. There is not enough strength or substance
in it to do any good. We sometimes have very good bean
soup when they have meat to boil with it.</p>

<p>Jan. 27.—More prisoners came to-day and say there is to be no
general exchange during the war, and we are to be sent off
into Georgia immediately. Stormy and disagreeable weather
and everybody down-hearted. Very still among the men, owing
to the bad news—hardly a word spoken by anybody. The least bit
off anything encouraging would change the stillness into a perfect
bedlam. I this morning looked into a tent where there were seventeen
men and started back frightened at the view inside. What a
tableau for a New York theatre? They were all old prisoners nearly
naked, very dirty and poor, some of them sick lying on the cold
ground with nothing under or over them, and no fire; had just been
talking over the prospect ahead and all looked the very picture of
dispair, with their hollow eyes, sunken cheeks and haggard expression.
I have before imagined such scenes but never before
realized what they were until now. And such is but a fair sample
of hundreds of men fully as bad.</p>

<p>Jan. 28.—No officers over from Libby for a few days past. Nearly
all the clothing issued. A few days more will close up the
clothing business, and then probably all the outsiders will be sent
inside; and for fear such will be the case we have decided upon
to-morrow night for the escape (which I have not said much about
in my diary). The nights are dark and cloudy. Messrs. Mustard
and Hendryx both sleep outside now, and I must manage to, both
to-night and to-morrow night. I have been two weeks trying to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
a map of Virginia, and have at last succeeded. A negro brought it
to me from the city. It has cost over thirty dollars Confederate
money—at the North would have cost twenty-five cents. I would
not take for it, unless I could get another one, one thousand dollars
in gold. We are well rigged, have some food saved up to take
along; in good health and determined to get away. Lieut. Bossieux
suspects, and to-day took the pains to say in our hearing that
he knew an escape among the outsiders was in view, and as sure as
there was a God in heaven if we tried it and got caught, and we
surely would be, he would first shoot all he could before catching
us, and the balance would be tied up and whipped every day until
he got tired, as long as we lived. We must expect trouble. It
does not change us in the least; if anything, makes us the more
determined to get away. To-night we are to start, and I will write
down the plans we have, running the risk of the rebels getting hold
of it. At a few moments past eleven and before midnight the
guard will let us cross his beat and go to the water’s edge. We all
have rebel clothing which we are to wear, furnished partly by a
negro, and partly by the guard who helps us off. We take the
quarter-master’s boat, which we unlock, and having been furnished
the countersign give it to the picket who will pretend that he
thinks we are rebel guards going over to the city, in case we are
caught, which will screen him in a measure. Having passed him,
we get into the boat and row across the river, give the countersign
to the guards on the other side of the river, and talk with them a
little, being ourselves posted on general information regarding the
place. To quiet their suspicions if they have any, we then start
up into the town and when out of sight of the guards take a turn
to the left, and go straight to the Richmond jail; taking care to
avoid patrols &amp;c. We will then meet with a negro who will guide
us ten miles up the river, and then leave us in charge of friendly
blacks who will keep us through the next day and at night pilot
us farther along toward our lives. If possible, I shall steal the
rebel flag, which is kept nights in the lieutenant’s tent, and a few
other relics, to take along with me. The big bell in Richmond
strikes six, and we close our diary, hoping never to look upon it
again until we return to free our fellow prisoners, with the glorious
army of the North. Now we leave our diary to finish preparations
for the flight for freedom. May God aid us in this land
of tyranny, where we have met nothing but suffering. Good bye,
Belle Isle and Prison. Hail! Freedom, Home, Friends, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Grand Army of the Old Flag! What is in store for us in the future?</p>

<p>Feb. 5.—Have been reading over the last few pages of my diary.
It sounds well, but the rebel flag still floats over Belle Isle. Our
escapade was a grand fizzle, and all hands have been punished in
more ways than one in the last few days. Bossieux suspected
something going on among us and had us secretly watched, and
long before we had made a move toward fulfilling our projected
plans we were thrown into a guard house on the island; next morning
taken out of it, and underwent a severe cross-questioning. He
found our rebel clothing, food we had packed, found the lock to
the boat broke, and numerous other signs of an abandonment.
Well, the result has been that we were bucked and gagged twice a
day for an hour each time, and for four hours each of us carried a
big stick of wood up and down in front of the gate, a guard to
prick us with his bayonet if we walked too slow to suit him. Then
Hendryx has been strung up by the thumbs. Nights we have been
thrown into a damp, cold guard house to shiver all night. Every
day now for six days we have walked with our sticks of wood so
many hours per day, and last night were turned inside with all the
prisoners to stay, Bossieux says, till we <em>rot</em>, he can place no
dependence in us.</p>

<p>Feb. 6.—We have to laugh over our trials and tribulations.
Where we had plenty a week ago, plenty of exercise, and many
favors, we are now right where we were at first, fareing just as the
rest, with no favors shown us. It’s all right, we can stand it just
as well as the rest. We have never belittled ourselves in the least
in our dealings with the rebels. Bossieux told us himself, as we
came inside, that he didn’t blame us in the least for trying to get
away, but he was obliged to punish us for the attempt. Hendryx
says that he will be out again in three days.</p>

<p>Feb. 8.—Butler reported as commissioner on exchange and the
rebels declare that they would never recognize him and would rather
that we should all die here than negotiate with the Beast. Congress
still in session over in the city and we watch the papers eagerly
for something relative to us. The Holy Sabbath day and the
church bells ringing for morning service. Don’t think I shall attend
this morning; it is such a long walk and then I look so bad;
have nothing fit to wear. A man stabbed a few minutes ago by his
tent mate, killing him instantly. They had all along been the best
friends until a dispute arose, and one of them drew a knife and
killed his comrade. Strong talk of lynching the murderer. Have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
not heard the particulars. Corp. McCartin is missing from the island
and am confident from what I have seen that he has escaped
and by the help of Lieut. Bossieux. No endeavors are being made
to look him up, still he offers a reward for his apprehension. They
are both members of the secret craft.</p>

<p>Feb. 9.—Great news this morning. A raid is being made on
Richmond by Kilpatrick. Rebels manning their forts in sight of
us. All are at work, women, children, in fact everybody who can
shovel. No cars running over the big bridge. Double guards
placed over us and the greatest activity prevails among them. It is
really amusing to see them flying around and many are the jokes
at their expense. All business is suspended in Richmond; no papers
issued, and everybody with their guns or working utensils.
Brass bands are playing their best to encourage the broken down
Confederacy. A portion of the congress came over this afternoon
to take a look at us, among whom were Davis, Benjamin and Howell
Cobb. They are a substantial looking set of men and of the
regular southern cut. The broad brim hats, gold headed canes and
aristocratic toss of the head, alone would tell who they were. They
are a proud, stern set of men and look as if they would like to
brush us out of existence. Still we are not going to be brushed out
so easy and they found men among us who were not afraid to stare,
or hold our heads as high as their lordships. A band accompanied
them and played the Bonnie Blue Flag, which was hissed and groaned
at by the Yankees, and in return a thousand voices sang Yankee
Doodle, very much to their discomfiture.</p>

<p>Feb. 10.—The hospital signal lights suspended over the island all
night in order to direct the batteries where to aim their pieces in
case of an outbreak which is greatly feared. Rockets sent up at
intervals during the night over Richmond. Reported that there
are six hundred muskets secreted among the prisoners and citizens
very much alarmed and afraid of us. I hope there is but cannot
believe it. It is impossible for me to sleep and I lay awake thinking
how we are situated and wondering how long the play is to
last.</p>

<p>Feb. 11.—Cold and pleasant. A good deal of fighting going on
among us—a discontented set of beings; just like so many hungry
wolves penned up together. Rebels still at work fortifying all
around Richmond. A number of Yankees have been taken out on
parole of honor to work building breastworks etc., but a very few
will go and it is considered a great crime among us to work for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
them. Have they forgotten our existence at the North? It seems
as if we were neglected by our government but will not judge them
hastily until we know more. There are perhaps sufficient reasons
for our remaining here. Very strongly guarded, nevertheless we
talk of escape and are all the while building air castles.</p>

<p>Feb. 12.—Lieut. Bossieux has sent a squad of men from the island
composed of runaways over to Castle Thunder to remain during
the war as hostages, among whom were our friends Myers and
Mustard. I never expect to see them again.</p>

<p>Feb. 13.—Very cold. The rebels are again settling down and getting
over their scare. Not much to eat now and the men more disheartened
than ever. A rebel preacher delivered us a sermon of
two hours length from a dry goods box. He was listened to attentively
and made the remark before closing that he didn’t know as
he was doing any good talking to us. It was like casting pearls before
swine and he would close his remarks, to which a Yankee told
him he might have stopped long ago if he had wanted to; no one
would have made any objections. Was told that six hundred are
to start for Georgia to-day and subsequently six hundred every day
until all are removed from Richmond. Lieut. Bossieux says it is
so but there is going to be an exchange of sick in a few days and all
outside hands shall be sent north with them.</p>

<p>Feb. 14.—Had quite an adventure last night with the raiders.
One of Capt. Moseby’s robbers was trying to steal a blanket from
our tent by reaching through the tent opening when Dad (E. P.
Sanders), who is always awake, threw a brick hitting him on the
arm, breaking the brick, and as he jumped, halloed to us, “Come
boys, let’s catch the rascal,” and out of the door he went. Dr. and
myself nobly rushed to the rescue and reached the door just in
time to see Dad turn a short corner way up the street and close on
to the heels of Mr. Robber, but he slipped and fell and the thief got
away. Were soon snugly ensconced in bed once more congratulating
ourselves on losing nothing as we thought. But on getting up
this morning I found my shoes gone and am barefoot in the middle
of winter. However I can get more and have no fear on that
score. Six hundred sent away to-day, some say to our lines while
others think to Georgia. Rebels say to our lines, and that a general
exchange has been agreed upon. Great excitement among the men.
Evening.—Lieut. Bossieux called me outside just before night and
told me he was called upon to furnish some hostages to be sent to
Charleston to be kept during the war, and had decided to send<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Hendryx and myself, with some others. Said it was better to send
those who were always trying to get away. Have succeeded in
buying a pair of shoes, which, although about four sizes too large,
are much better than none. Thanks to the Sanitary Commission I
have good woolen stockings, under clothing complete, and am
otherwise well dressed. Six hundred sent away this afternoon
under a very strong guard, which does not look like an exchange.</p>

<p>Feb. 17.—Still on the island. Another squad taken out yesterday.
It will not be our turn to go for some days, even if six
hundred are taken out every day. Have not been sent for as hostages
yet. Hendryx and myself have decided to flank out and go
with the next that go, no matter where their destination may be.
If we don’t get away, with a ghost of a chance, then it will be
funny.</p>

<p>Feb. 20.—All sorts of rumors afloat, but still we stay here.
Strange officers come over and look at us. Bossieux away considerable,
and something evidently up. Anything for a change.
My health is good, and tough as a bear.</p>

<p>Feb. 23.—None have been taken away from the island for a
number of days. Have heard that a box came for me, and is over
in Richmond. Hope the rebel that eats the contents of that box
will get choked to death. I wrote to the Governor of Michigan,
Austin Blair, who is in Washington, D. C., some weeks ago. He
has known me from boyhood. Always lived in the neighborhood
at Jackson, Mich. Asked him to notify my father and brothers of
my whereabouts. To-day I received a letter from him saying that
he had done as requested, also that the Sanitary Commission had
sent me some eatables. This is undoubtedly the box which I have
heard from and is over in Richmond. Rebels are trying to get
recruits from among us for their one-horse Confederacy. Believe
that one or two have deserted our ranks and gone over. Bad luck
to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pemerton Building</span>, Richmond, Va., Feb. 24.—We are confined
on the third floor of the building, which is a large tobacco
warehouse. Was removed from the island yesterday. Was a
warm day and it was a long walk. Came across the “long bridge,”
and it is a long bridge. Was not sorry to bid adieu to Belle Isle.
Were searched last night but our mess has lost nothing, owing to
the following process we have of fooling them: One of the four
manages to be in the front part of the crowd and is searched first,
and is then put on the floor underneath and we let our traps down
through a crack in the floor to him, and when our turn comes we
have nothing about us worth taking away. The men so ravenous
when the rations were brought in, that the boxes of bread and tubs
of poor meat were raided upon before dividing, and consequently
some had nothing to eat at all, while others had plenty. Our mess
did not get a mouthful and have had nothing to eat since yesterday
afternoon, and it is now nearly dark. The lice are very thick.
You can see them all over the floors, walls, &amp;c., in fact everything
literally covered with them; they seem much larger than the stock
on Belle Isle and a different species. We talk of escape night
and day—and are nearly crazy on the subject. No more news
about exchange. Papers state that Richmond is threatened, and
that Kilpatrick’s cavalry is making a raid on the place for the purpose
of releasing us and burning the town. Unusual bustle among
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>Feb. 25.—We divide the night up into four watches and take
turns standing guard while the other three sleep, to protect ourselves
from Captain Moseby’s gang of robbers. We are all armed
with iron slats pulled off the window casings. They are afraid to
pitch in to us, as we are a stout crowd and would fight well for our
worldly goods. We expect to take it before long. They are eyeing
us rather sharp, and I guess will make an attack to-night.
Very long days and more lonesome than when on the island. Got
rations to-day, and the allowance did not half satisfy our hunger.</p>

<p>Feb. 26.—Rather cold, almost spring. Guards unusually strict.
Hendryx was standing near the window, and I close by him, looking
at the high, ten story tobacco building, when the guard fired at
us. The ball just grazed Hendryx’s head and lodged in the ceiling
above; all we could do to prevent Hendryx throwing a brick at the
guard.</p>

<p>Feb. 27.—Organizing the militia; hauling artillery past the
prison. Have a good view of all that is going on. Bought a compass
from one of the guards for seven dollars, greenbacks; worth
half a dollar at home. It is already rumored among the men that
we have a compass, a map of Virginia, a preparation to put on our
feet to prevent dogs from tracking us, and we are looked up to as
if we were sons of Irish lords in disguise, and are quite noted personages.
Cold last night, and we suffer much in not having blankets
enough to keep us warm. The walls are cold and damp,
making it disagreeable, and the stench nearly makes us sick. It is
impossible for a person to imagine prison life until he has seen and
realized it. No news of importance. Time passes much more
drearily than when on Belle Isle. Were all searched again to-day
but still keep my diary, although expecting to lose it every day;
would be quite a loss, as the longer I write and remain a prisoner
the more attached am I to my record of passing events. A man
shot for putting his head out of the window. Men all say it served
him right, for he had no business to thus expose himself against
strict orders to the contrary. We are nearly opposite and not more
than twenty rods from Libby Prison, which is a large tobacco warehouse.
Can see plenty of union officers, which it is a treat to look
at. Hendryx had a fight with the raiders—got licked. He ain’t so
pretty as he was before, but knows more. I am very wise about
such matters, consequently retain my beauty.</p>

<p>Feb. 28.—Had the honor (?) of seeing Jefferson Davis again and
part of his congress to-day. They visited Libby and we were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
allowed to look out of the windows to see them as they passed in
and out of the building. Strut around like chickens with frozen
feet. David Benjamin walked with the President and is a much
better looking man. Prisoners were notified that if they made any
insulting remarks they would be fired at. Have no more exalted
opinion of them than before.</p>

<p>Feb. 29.—Excitement among the Johnnies—flying around as if
the Yankee army were threatening Richmond. Cannot learn what
the commotion is, but hope it is something that will benefit us.
<span class="smcap">Later</span>: The occasion of the excitement among the rebels is that
Dahlgreen is making a raid on Richmond, acting in conjunction
with Kilpatrick, for the purpose of liberating prisoners. We are
heavily guarded and not allowed to look out of the windows, nevertheless
we manage to see about all there is going on.</p>

<p>Feb. 30.—Rebels in hot water all night and considerably agitated.
Imagined we could hear firing during the night. This morning
small squads of tired out union soldiers marched by our prison
under guard, evidently captured through the night. Look as if
they was completely played out. Go straggling by sometimes not
more than half a dozen at a time. Would give something to hear
the news. We are all excitement here. Negroes also go by in
squads sometimes of hundreds in charge of overseers, and singing
their quaint negro melodies. It is supposed by us that the negroes
work on the fortifications, and are moved from one part of the
city to another, for that purpose. Our troops have evidently been
repulsed with considerable loss. We hear that Dahlgreen has been
shot and killed. At the very first intimation that our troops were
anywhere near, the prisoners would have made a break.</p>

<p>March 1.—Working along towards Spring slowly. A dead calm
after the raid scare. We much prefer the open air imprisonment
to confinement. Have considerable trouble with the thieves which
disgrace the name of union soldier. Are the most contemptible
rascals in existence. Often walk up to a man and coolly take his
food and proceed to eat it before the owner. If the victim resists
then a fight is the consequence, and the poor man not only loses
his food but gets licked as well.</p>

<p>March 2.—The food we get here is poor, water very good,
weather outside admirable, vermin still under control and the
“Astor House Mess” flourishing. We are all in good health with
the exception of Dr. Lewis, who is ailing. I was never tougher—seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
as if your humble servant was proof against the hardest
rebel treatment. No exchange news. Trade and dicker with the
guards and work ourselves into many luxuries, or rather work the
luxuries into ourselves. Have become quite interested in a young
soldier boy from Ohio named Bill Havens. Is sick with some kind
of fever and is thoroughly bad off. Was tenderly brought up and
well educated I should judge. Says he ran away from home to
become a drummer. Has been wounded twice, in numerous engagements,
now a prisoner of war and sick. Will try and keep
track of him. Every nationality is here represented and from
every branch of the service, and from all parts of the world.
There are smart men here and those that are not so smart, in fact a
conglomeration of humanity—hash, as it were.</p>

<p>March 3.—The ham given us to-day was rotten, with those nameless
little white things crawling around through it. Promptly
threw it out of the window and was scolded for it by a fellow prisoner
who wanted it himself. Shall never become hungry enough
to eat poor meat. Guards careless with their guns. An old man
shot in the arm. Hendryx tried to pull a brick out of the casing
to throw at the shooter. Barbarians these rebs.</p>

<p>March 4.—And now we are getting ready to move somewhere,
the Lord only knows where. One good thing about their old prisons,
we are always ready for a change. Have made many new
acquaintances while here in Pemberton, and some agreeable ones;
my boy Havens has fever and chills. Is rather better to-day. It is
said we move to-night. Minnesota Indians confined here, and a
number of sailors and marines. I am quite a hand to look at men,
sometimes for hours, and study them over, then get to talking with
them and see how near I was right in my conjectures. Its almost
as good as reading books. The Astor House Mess is now composed
of but four members, E. P. Sanders, F. L. Lewis, Geo. W. Hendryx
and myself; we still adhere to our sanitary regulations and as
a consequence are in better health than a majority of those here.
Sanders may be said to be at the head of the mess, (we call him
Dad,) while Lewis is a sort of moderator and advisor, with Hendryx
and myself as the rank and file. Are quite attached to
one another, and don’t believe that either one would steal from the
other. I certainly wouldn’t take anything short of pumpkin pie or
something of that sort. Of course a man would steal pie, at least
we all say so, and Lewis even declares he would steal dough cakes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
and pancakes such as his wife used to make. We are all well
dressed, thanks to the Sanitary Commission and our own ingenuity
in getting what was intended for us to have. False alarm of fire.</p>


<hr class="r10">
<p class="p2b center fs135">Routed at Midnight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On the Cars</span>, March 7, 1864.—We were roused from our gentle
slumbers during the night, counted off and marched to
the cars, loaded into them, which had evidently just had some
cattle as occupants. Started southward to some portion of Georgia,
as a guard told us. Passed through Petersburg, and other towns
which I could not learn the names of. Cars run very slow, and
being crowded, we are very uncomfortable—and hungry. Before
leaving Richmond hard-tack was issued to us in good quantity for
the Confederacy. Have not much chance to write. Bought some
boiled sweet potatoes of the guard, which are boss. The country
we pass through is a miserable one. Guards watch us close to see
that none escape, and occasionally a Yank is shot, but not in our
car. Seems as if we did not run over thirty or forty miles per day.
Stop for hours on side tracks, waiting for other trains to pass us.</p>

<p>March 8.—Were unloaded last night and given a chance to
straighten our limbs. Stayed all night in the woods, side of the
track, under a heavy guard. Don’t know where we are, as guards
are very reticent.</p>

<p>March 10.—Still traveling, and unloaded nights to sleep by the
track. Rebel citizens and women improve every opportunity to
see live Yankees. Are fed passably well. Lewis feeling poorly.
Watch a chance to escape but find none.</p>

<p>March 13.—Ran very slow through the night, and are in the vicinity
of Macon, Ga. Will reach our prison to-night. Received a
pone of corn bread apiece weighing about two pounds, which is
liberal on their part. Two more days such riding as this would kill
me. The lice are fairly eating us up alive, having had no chance
to rid ourselves of them since leaving Richmond. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
guards struck Hendryx during the night. We were talking on the
all important subject, and the guard hearing us chatting away to
ourselves struck over into the crowd where the noise came from
and hit George in the back part of the head. He didn’t speak for
a minute or two and I was afraid it had killed him, which happily
proved to the contrary. As soon as it came daylight he showed
the brute where he had struck him, and took the occasion to dress
him down a little, whereupon the rebel threatened that if he said
another word to him he would blow his head off. A drizzling rain
has set in.</p>

<p>ARRIVAL AT THE WORST OF ALL PRISONS—BEGINNING OF A SUMMER
THAT KILLED THIRTEEN THOUSAND MEN—BAD WATER, BAD FOOD,
AND MOST INHUMAN TREATMENT—IN THE CLUTCHES OF WIRTZ
AND HIS PICKED OUT REBEL AIDS—THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT
THE TRUTH—A SEASON OF INTENSE SUFFERING.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Camp Sumpter</span>, Andersonville, Ga., March 14.—Arrived at our
destination at last and a dismal hole it is, too. We got off the
cars at two o’clock this morning in a cold rain, and were marched
into our pen between a strong guard carrying lighted pitch pine
knots to prevent our crawling off in the dark. I could hardly walk
have been cramped up so long, and feel as if I was a hundred
years old. Have stood up ever since we came from the cars, and
shivering with the cold. The rain has wet us to the skin and we
are worn out and miserable. Nothing to eat to-day, and another
dismal night just setting in.</p>

<p>March 15.—At about midnight I could stand up no longer, and
lay down in the mud and water. Could hardly get up. Shall get
food this morning, and after eating shall feel better. There is a
good deal to write about here, but I must postpone it until some
future time, for I can hardly hold a pencil now. <span class="smcap">Later</span>: Have
drawn some rations which consisted of nearly a quart of corn-meal,
half a pound of beef, and some salt. This is splendid. I have just
partaken of a delicious repast and feel like a different person. Dr.
Lewis is discouraged and thinks he cannot live long in such a place
as this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>March 16.—The prison is not yet entirely completed. One side
is yet open, and through the opening two pieces of artillery are
pointed. About 1800 Yankees are here now. Col. Piersons commands
the prison, and rides in and talks with the men. Is quite
sociable, and says we are all to be exchanged in a few weeks. He
was informed that such talk would not go down any longer. We
had been fooled enough, and paid no attention to what they told
us. Our mess is gradually settling down. Have picked out our
ground, rolled some big logs together, and are trying to make ourselves
comfortable. I am in the best of spirits, and will live with
them for some time to come if they will only give me one-quarter
enough to eat, and they are doing it now, and am in my glory.
Weather cleared up, and very cold nights. We put on all our
clothes nights and take them off day-times. The men do most of
their sleeping through the day, and shiver through the long nights.</p>

<p>March 17.—Get almost enough to eat, such as it is, but don’t
get it regularly; sometimes in the morning, and sometimes in the
afternoon. Six hundred more prisoners came last night, and from
Belle Isle, Va., our old home. Andersonville is situated on two
hillsides, with a small stream of swampy water running through
the center, and on both sides of the stream is a piece of swamp with
two or three acres in it. We have plenty of wood now, but it will
not last long. They will undoubtedly furnish us with wood from
the outside, when it is burned up on the inside. A very unhealthy
climate. A good many are being poisoned by poisonous roots, and
there is a thick green scum on the water. All who drink freely are
made sick, and their faces swell up so they cannot see.</p>

<p>March 18.—There are about fifteen acres of ground enclosed in
the stockade and we have the freedom of the whole ground. Plenty
of room, but they are filling it up. Six hundred new men coming
each day from Richmond. Guards are perched upon top of
the stockade; are very strict, and to-day one man was shot for
approaching too near the wall. A little warm to-day. Found W.
B. Rowe, from Jackson, Mich.; he is well and talks encouraging.
We have no shelter of any kind whatever. Eighteen or twenty die
per day. Cold and damp nights. The dews wet things through
completely, and by morning all nearly chilled. Wood getting
scarce. On the outside it is a regular wilderness of pines. Railroad
a mile off and can just see the cars as they go by, which is
the only sign of civilization in sight. Rebels all the while at work
making the prison stronger. Very poor meal, and not so much to-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
as formerly. My young friend Billy Havens was sent to the
hospital about the time we left Richmond. Shall be glad to hear
of his recovery. Prevailing conversation is food and exchange.</p>

<p>March 19.—A good deal of fighting going on among us. A large
number of sailors and marines are confined with us, and they are a
quarrelsome set. I have a very sore hand, caused by cutting a
hole through the car trying to get out. I have to write with my
left hand. It is going to be an awful place during the summer
months here, and thousands will die no doubt.</p>

<p>March 21.—Prison gradually filling up with forlorn looking creatures.
Wood is being burned up gradually. Have taken in my old
acquaintance and a member of my own company “A” 9th Mich.
Cavalry, Wm. B. Rowe. Sergt. Rowe is a tall, straight, dark complexioned
man, about thirty-five years old. He was captured while
carrying dispatches from Knoxville to Gen. Burnside. Has been a
prisoner two or three months, and was in Pemerton Building until
sent here. He is a tough, able-bodied man. Every day I find
new Michigan men, some of them old acquaintances.</p>

<p>March 23.—Stockade all up, and we are penned in. Our mess
is out of filthy lucre—otherwise, busted. Sold my overcoat to a
guard, and for luxuries we are eating that up. My blanket keeps
us all warm. There are two more in our mess. Daytimes the large
spread is stretched three or four feet high on four sticks, and keeps
off the sun, and at night taken down for a cover.</p>

<p>March 24.—Digging a tunnel to get out of this place. Prison
getting filthy. Prisoners somewhat to blame for it. Good many
dying, and they are those who take no care of themselves, drink
poor water, etc.</p>

<p>March 25.—Lieut. Piersons is no longer in command of the prison,
but instead a Capt. Wirtz. Came inside to-day and looked us
over. Is not a very prepossessing looking chap. Is about thirty-five
or forty years old, rather tall, and a little stoop shouldered;
skin has a pale, white livered look, with thin lips. Has a sneering
sort of cast of countenance. Makes a fellow feel as if he would
like to go up and boot him. Should judge he was a Swede, or
some such countryman. Hendryx thinks he could make it warm
for him in short order if he only had a chance. Wirtz wears
considerable jewelry on his person—long watch chain, something
that looks like a diamond for a pin in his shirt, and wears patent
leather boots or shoes. I asked him if he didn’t think we would
be exchanged soon. He said: Oh, yes, we would be exchanged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
soon. Somehow or other this assurance don’t elate us much; perhaps
it was his manner when saying it. Andersonville is getting
to be a rather bad place as it grows warmer. Several sick with
fevers and sores.</p>

<p>March 26.—Well, well, my birthday came six days ago, and how
old do you think I am? Let me see. Appearances would seem to
indicate that I am thirty or thereabouts, but as I was born on the
20th day of March, 1843, I must now be just twenty-one years of
age, this being the year 1864. Of age and six days over. I thought
that when a man became of age, he generally became free and his
own master as well. If this ain’t a burlesque on that old time-honored
custom, then carry me out—but not feet foremost.</p>

<p>March 27.—We have issued to us once each day about a pint of
beans, or more properly peas, (full of bugs), and three-quarters of a
pint of meal, and nearly every day a piece of bacon the size of your
two fingers, probably about three or four ounces. This is very
good rations taken in comparison to what I have received before.
The pine which we use in cooking is pitch pine, and a black smoke
arises from it; consequently we are black as negroes. Prison gradually
filling from day to day, and situation rather more unhealthy.
Occasionally a squad comes in who have been lately captured,
and they tell of our battles, sometimes victorious and sometimes
otherwise. Sometimes we are hopeful and sometimes the reverse.
Take all the exercise we can, drink no water, and try to get along.
It is a sad sight to see the men die so fast. New prisoners die the
quickest and are buried in the near vicinity, we are told in trenches
without coffins. Sometimes we have visitors of citizens and women
who come to look at us. There is sympathy in some of their faces
and in some a lack of it. A dead line composed of slats of boards
runs around on the inside of the wall, about twelve or fourteen feet
from the wall, and we are not allowed to go near it on pain of being
shot by the guard.</p>

<p>March 28.—We are squadded over to-day, and rations about to
come in. It’s a sickly dirty place. Seems as if the sun was not
over a mile high, and has a particular grudge against us. Wirtz
comes inside and has began to be very insolent. Is constantly
watching for tunnels. He is a brute. We call him the “Flying
Dutchman.” Came across Sergt. Bullock, of my regiment, whom
I last saw on Belle Isle. From a fat, chubby young fellow, he is a
perfect wreck. Lost his voice and can hardly speak aloud; nothing
but skin and bone, and black and ragged. Never saw such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
change in a human being. Cannot possibly live, I don’t think; still
he is plucky and hates to die. Goes all around enquiring for news,
and the least thing encouraging cheers him up. Capt. Moseby, of
the raiders, is in the same squad with me. He is quite an intelligent
fellow and often talks with us. We lend him our boiling cup
which he returns with thanks. Better to keep on the right side of
him, if we can without countenancing his murderous operations.</p>

<p>March 29.—Raiders getting more bold as the situation grows
worse. Often rob a man now of all he has, in public, making no
attempt at concealment. In sticking up for the weaker party, our
mess gets into trouble nearly every day, and particularly Hendryx,
who will fight any time.</p>

<p>March 30.—The gate opens every little while letting some poor
victims into this terrible place, which is already much worse than
Belle Isle. Seems as if our government is at fault in not providing
some way to get us out of here. The hot weather months must kill
us all outright. Feel myself at times sick and feverish with no
strength seemingly. Dr. Lewis worries, worries, all the day long,
and it’s all we can do to keep him from giving up entirely. Sergt.
Rowe takes things as they come in dogged silence. Looks like a
caged lion. Hendryx sputters around, scolding away, &amp;c.</p>

<p>April 1.—This is an April Fool sure. Saw a fellow to-day from
our regiment, named Casey. Says I was reported dead at the regiment,
which is cheerful. Perhaps it is just as well though, for
them to anticipate the event a few months. It is said that Wirtz
shot some one this morning. Often hear the guards shoot and hear
of men being killed. Am not ambitious to go near them. Have
completely lost my desire to be on the outside working for extra
rations. Prefer to stick it out where I am than to have anything
to do with them. They are an ungodly crew, and should have the
warmest corner in that place we sometimes hear mentioned.</p>

<p>April 2—James Robins, an Indiana soldier, is in our close proximity.
Was wounded and taken prisoner not long since. Wound,
which is in the thigh, is in a terrible condition, and gangrene setting
in. Although he was carried to the gate to-day, was refused
admission to the hospital or medical attendance. Rebels say they
have no medicine for us. Robins has been telling me about
himself and family at home, and his case is only one of a great
many good substantial men of families who must die in Southern
prisons, as victims to mismanagement. The poorer the Confederacy,
and the meaner they are, the more need that our government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
should get us away from here, and not put objectionable men at
the head of exchange to prevent our being sent home or back to
our commands.</p>

<p>April 3—We have stopped wondering at suffering or being surprised
at anything. Can’t do the subject justice and so don’t try.
Walk around camp every morning looking for acquaintances, the
sick, &amp;c. Can see a dozen most any morning laying around dead.
A great many are terribly afflicted with diarrhea and scurvy begins
to take hold of some. Scurvy is a bad disease, and taken in connection
with the former is sure death. Some have dropsy as well
as scurvy, and the swollen limbs and body are sad to see. To think
that these victims have people at home, mothers, wives and sisters,
who are thinking of them and would do much for them if they had
the chance, little dreaming of their condition.</p>

<p>April 4.—Same old story—coming in and being carried out;
all have a feeling of lassitude which prevents much exertion. Have
been digging in a tunnel for a day or two with a dozen others who
are in the secret. It’s hard work. A number of tunnels have been
discovered. The water now is very warm and sickening.</p>

<p>April 5.—Dr. Lewis talks about nothing except his family. Is
the bluest mortal here, and worries himself sick, let alone causes
sufficient for that purpose. Is poorly adapted for hardships. For
reading we have the “Pilgrim’s Progress,” donated to me by some
one when on Belle Isle. Guess I can repeat nearly all the book by
heart. Make new acquaintances every day. “Scotty,” a marine,
just now is edifying our mess with his salt water yarns, and they
are tough ones. I tell him he may die here; still he declares they
are true.</p>

<p>April 6—John Smith is here and numerous of his family. So
many go by nick-names, that seldom any go by their real names.
Its “Minnesota,” “Big Charlie,” “Little Jim,” “Marine Jack,”
“Indiana Feller,” “Mopey,” “Skinny,” “Smarty,” &amp;c. Hendryx
is known by the latter name, Sanders is called “Dad,” Rowe is
called the “Michigan Sergeant,” Lewis is called plain “Doc.”
while I am called, for some unknown reason, “Bugler.” I have
heard it said that I looked just like a Dutch bugler, and perhaps
that is the reason of my cognomen. Probably thirty die per day.
The slightest news about exchange is told from one to the other,
and gains every time repeated, until finally its grand good news and
sure exchange immediately. The weak ones feed upon these reports<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
and struggle along from day to day. One hour they are all
hope and expectation and the next hour as bad the other way. The
worst looking scallawags perched upon the stockade as guards, from
boys just large enough to handle a gun, to old men who ought to
have been dead years ago for the good of their country. Some
prisoners nearly naked, the majority in rags and daily becoming
more destitute. My clothes are good and kept clean, health fair
although very poor in flesh. Man killed at the dead line.</p>

<p>April 7.—Capt. Wirtz prowls around the stockade with a rebel
escort of guards, looking for tunnels. Is very suspicious of amateur
wells which some have dug for water. It is useless to speak
to him about our condition, as he will give us no satisfaction whatever.
Says it is good enough for us —— yankees. I am deputized
by half a dozen or so to speak to him as to the probabilities
of a change, and whether we may not reasonably expect to be exchanged
without passing the summer here. In his position he must
know something in relation to our future. At the first favorable
moment shall approach his highness. Prison is all the time being
made stronger, more guards coming and artillery looking at us
rather unpleasantly from many directions. Think it impossible for
any to get away here, so far from our lines. The men too are not
able to withstand the hardships attendant upon an escape, still
fully one-half of all here are constantly on the alert for chances to
get away. Foremost in all schemes for freedom is Hendryx, and
we are engaging in a new tunnel enterprise. The yankee is a curious
animal, never quiet until dead. There are some here who pray and
try to preach. Very many too who have heretofore been religiously
inclined, throw off all restraint and are about the worst.
Tried and found wanting it seems to me. Those who find the least
fault, make the best of things as they come and grin and bear it,
get along the best. Weather getting warmer, water warmer and
nastier, food worse and less in quantities, and more prisoners coming
nearly every day.</p>

<p>April 8.—We are digging with an old fire shovel at our tunnel.
The shovel is a prize; we also use half of canteens, pieces of boards,
&amp;c. Its laborious work. A dozen are engaged in it. Like going
into a grave to go into a tunnel. Soil light and liable to cave in.
Take turns in digging. Waste dirt carried to the stream in small
quantities and thrown in. Not much faith in the enterprise, but
work with the rest as a sort of duty. Raiders acting fearful. Was
boiling my cup of meal to-day and one of the raiders ran against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
it and over it went. Give him a whack side of the head that made
him see stars I should judge, and in return he made me see the
whole heavens. Battese, a big Indian, rather helped me out of the
scrape. All of our mess came to my rescue. Came near being a
big fight with dozens engaged. Battese is a large full blooded six
foot Minnesota Indian, has quarters near us, and is a noble fellow.
He and other Indians have been in our hundred for some weeks.
They are quiet, attend to their own business, and won’t stand much
nonsense. Great deal of fighting. One Duffy, a New York rough,
claims the light weight championship of Andersonville. Regular
battles quite often. Remarkable how men will stand up and be
pummeled. Dr. Lewis daily getting worse off. Is troubled with
scurvy and dropsy. If he was at home would be considered dangerously
ill and in bed, but he walks around slowly inquiring for
news in a pitiful way. I have probably fifty acquaintances here
that visit us each day to talk the situation over. Jimmy Devers,
my Michigan friend whom I found on Belle Isle, Sergt. Bullock, of
my regiment; Tom McGill, also of Michigan; Michael Hoare, a
schoolmate of mine from earliest recollection, Dorr Blakeman, also
a resident of Jackson, Michigan, a little fellow named Swan, who
lived in Ypsylanti, Mich.; Burckhardt from near Lansing; Hub
Dakin, from Dansville, Mich., and many others, meet often to
compare notes, and we have many a hearty laugh in the midst of
misery. I dicker and trade and often make an extra ration. We
sometimes draw small cow peas for rations, and being a printer by
trade, I spread the peas out on a blanket and quickly pick them up
one at a time, after the manner of picking up type. One drawback
is the practice of unconsciously putting the beans into my
mouth. In this way I often eat up the whole printing office. I
have trials of skill with a fellow named Land, who is also a printer.
There are no other typos here that I know of.</p>

<p>April 9.—See here Mr. Confederacy, this is going a little too far.
You have no business to kill us off at this rate. About thirty or
forty die daily. They have rigged up an excuse for a hospital
on the outside, where the sick are taken. Admit none though who
can walk or help themselves in any way. Some of our men are detailed
to help as nurses, but in a majority of cases those who go out
on parole of honor are cut-throats and robbers, who abuse a sick
prisoner. Still, there are exceptions to this rule. We hear stories
of Capt. Wirtz’s cruelty in punishing the men, but I hardly credit
all the stories. More prisoners to-day. Some captured near Petersburg.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Don’t know anything about exchange. Scurvy and dropsy
taking hold of the men. Many are blind as soon as it becomes
night, and it is called moon blind. Caused, I suppose, by sleeping
with the moon shining in the face. Talked with Michael Hoare,
an old school fellow of mine. Mike was captured while we were in
Pemerton Building, and was one of Dahlgreen’s men. Was taken
right in the suburbs of Richmond. Has told me all the news of
their failure on account of Kilpatrick failing to make a junction at
some point. Mike is a great tall, slim fellow, and a good one.
Said he heard my name called out in Richmond as having a box of
eatables from the North. He also saw a man named Shaw claim
the box with a written order from me, Shaw was one of our mess
on Belle Isle. He was sent to Richmond while sick, from the
island, knew of my expecting the box, and forged an order to get
it. Well, that was rough, still I probably wouldn’t have got it any
way. Better him than some rebel. Mike gave me a lot of black
pepper which we put into our soup, which is a luxury. He has no
end of talk at his tongue’s end, and it is good to hear. Recounts
how once when I was about eight or ten years old and he some
older, I threw a base ball club and hit him on the shins. Then ran
and he couldn’t catch me. It was when we were both going to
school to A. A. Henderson, in Jackson, Mich. Think I remember
the incident, and am strongly under the impression that he caught
me. It is thus that old friends meet after many years. John McGuire
is also here, another Jackson man. He has a family at home
and is worried. Says he used to frequently see my brother George
at Hilton Head, before being captured.</p>

<p>April 10.—Getting warmer and warmer. Can see the trees swaying
back and forth on the outside, but inside not a breath of fresh
air. Our wood is all gone, and we are now digging up stumps and
roots for fuel to cook with. Some of the first prisoners here have
passable huts made of logs, sticks, pieces of blankets, &amp;c. Room
about all taken up in here now. Rations not so large. Talk that
they intend to make the meal into bread before sending it inside,
which will be an improvement. Rations have settled down to less
than a pint of meal per day, with occasionally a few peas, or an
apology for a piece of bacon, for each man. Should judge that
they have hounds on the outside to catch runaways, from the
noise. Wirtz don’t come in as much as formerly. The men make
it uncomfortable for him. As Jimmy Devers says, “He is a terror.”
I have omitted to mention Jimmy’s name of late, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
he is with us all the time—not in our mess, but close by. He has
an old pack of cards with which we play to pass away the time.
Many of the men have testaments, and “house-wives” which they
have brought with them from home, and it is pitiful to see them
look at these things while thinking of their loved ones at home.</p>

<p>April 11.—Dr. Lewis is very bad off with the scurvy and diarrhea.
We don’t think he can stand it much longer, but make out
to him that he will stick it through. Our government must hear
of our condition here and get us away before long. If they don’t,
its a poor government to tie to. Hendryx and myself are poor, as
also are all the mess. Still in good health compared with the generality
of the prisoners. Jimmy Devers has evidently sort of dried
up, and it don’t seem to make any difference whether he gets anything
to eat or not. He has now been a prisoner of war nearly a
year, and is in good health and very hopeful of getting away in
time. Sticks up for our government and says there is some good
reason for our continued imprisonment. I can see none. As many
as 12,000 men here now, and crowded for room. Death rate is in
the neighborhood of eighty per day. Hendryx prowls around all
over the prison, bringing us what good news he can, which is not
much. A very heavy dew nights, which is almost a rain. Rebels
very domineering. Many are tunneling to get out. Our tunnel
has been abandoned, as the location was not practicable. Yank
shot to-day near our quarters. Approached too near the dead line.
Many of the men have dug down through the sand and reached
water, but it is poor; no better than out of the creek.</p>

<p>April 12.—Another beautiful but warm day with no news. Insects
of all descriptions making their appearance, such as lizards,
a worm four or five inches long, fleas, maggots &amp;c. There is so
much filth about the camp that it is terrible trying to live here.
New prisoners are made sick the first hours of their arrival by the
stench which pervades the prison. Old prisoners do not mind it so
much, having become used to it. No visitors come near us any
more. Everybody sick, almost, with scurvy—an awful disease.
New cases every day. I am afraid some contagious disease will get
among us, and if so every man will die. My blanket a perfect God-send.
Is large and furnishes shelter from the burning sun. Hendryx
has a very sore arm which troubles him much. Even he
begins to look and feel bad. James Gordan, or Gordenian, (I don’t
know which) was killed to-day by the guard. In crossing the creek
on a small board crossway men are often shot. It runs very near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the dead line, and guards take the occasion to shoot parties who
put their hands on the dead line in going across. Some also reach
up under the dead line to get purer water, and are shot. Men
seemingly reckless of their lives. New prisoners coming in and
are shocked at the sights.</p>

<p>April 13.—Jack Shannon, from Ann Arbor, died this morning.
The raiders are the stronger party now, and do as they please; and
we are in nearly as much danger now from our own men as from
the rebels. Capt. Moseby, of my own hundred, figures conspicuously
among the robberies, and is a terrible villain. During the
night some one stole my jacket. Have traded off all superfluous
clothes, and with the loss of jacket have only pants, shirt, shoes,
(no stockings,) and hat; yet I am well dressed in comparison with
some others. Many have nothing but an old pair of pants which
reach, perhaps, to the knees, and perhaps not. Hendryx has two
shirts, and should be mobbed. I do quite a business trading rations,
making soup for the sick ones, taking in payment their raw food
which they cannot eat. Get many a little snack by so doing.</p>

<p>April 14.—At least twenty fights among our own men this forenoon.
It beats all what a snarling crowd we are getting to be.
The men are perfectly reckless, and had just as soon have their
necks broken by fighting as anything else. New onions in camp.
Very small, and sell for $2 a bunch of four or five. Van Tassel, a
Pennsylvanian, is about to die. Many give me parting injunctions
relative to their families, in case I should live through. Have half
a dozen photographs of dead men’s wives, with addresses on the
back of them. Seems to be pretty generally conceded that if any
get through, I will. Not a man here now is in good health. An
utter impossibility to remain well. Signs of scurvy about my person.
Still adhere to our sanitary rules. Lewis anxious to get to
the hospital. Will die any way shortly, whether there or here.
Jimmy Devers, the old prisoner, coming down. Those who have
stood it bravely begin to weaken.</p>

<p>April 15.—The hospital is a tough place to be in, from all
accounts. The detailed Yankees as soon as they get a little authority
are certain to use it for all it is worth. In some cases before a
man is fairly dead, he is stripped of everything, coat, pants, shirt,
finger rings (if he has any), and everything of value taken away.
These the nurses trade to the guards. Does not seem possible but
such is the case, sad to relate. Not very pleasant for a man just
breathing his last, and perhaps thinking of loved ones at home who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
are all so unconscious of the condition of their soldier father or
brother, to be suddenly jerked about and fought over, with the
cursing and blaspheming he is apt to hear. The sick now, or a
portion of them, are huddled up in one corner of the prison,
to get as bad as they can before being admitted to the outside hospital.
Every day I visit it, and come away sick at heart that
human beings should be thus treated.</p>

<p>April 26.—Ten days since I wrote in my diary, and in those ten
days was too much occupied in trying to dig a tunnel to escape
out of, to write any. On the 21st the tunnel was opened and two
fellows belonging to a Massachusetts regiment escaped to the outside.
Hendryx and myself next went out. The night was very
dark. Came up out of the ground away on the outside of the
guard. We crawled along to gain the woods, and get by some
pickets, and when forty or fifty rods from the stockade, a shot was
fired at some one coming out of the hole. We immediately jumped
up and ran for dear life, seemingly making more noise than a troop
of cavalry. It was almost daylight and away we went. Found I
could not run far and we slowed up, knowing we would be caught,
but hoping to get to some house and get something to eat first.
Found I was all broke up for any exertion. In an hour we had
traveled perhaps three miles, were all covered with mud, and
scratched up. I had fell, too, in getting over some logs, and it
seemed to me broken all the ribs in my body. Just as it was coming
light in the east we heard dogs after us. We expected it, and
so armed ourselves with clubs and sat down on a log. In a few moments
the hounds came up with us and began smelling of us.
Pretty soon five mounted rebels arrived on the scene of action.
They laughed to think we expected to get away. Started us back
towards our charnel pen. Dogs did not offer to bite us, but guards
told us that if we had offered resistance or started to run they
would have torn us. Arrived at the prison and after waiting an
hour Capt. Wirtz interviewed us. After cussing us a few minutes
we were put in the chain gang, where we remained two days. This
was not very fine, but contrary to expectation not so bad after all.
We had more to eat than when inside, and we had shade to lay in,
and although my ancles were made very sore, do not regret my
escapade. Am not permanently hurt any. We had quite an allowance
of bacon while out, and some spring water to drink. Also
from the surgeon I got some elder berries to steep into a tea to
drink for scurvy, which is beginning to take hold of me. Lewis is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
sick and can hardly walk around. His days are few. Have taken
another into our mess, named Swan, from Ypsilanti, Michigan. Is
a fresh looking boy for this place and looks like a girl.</p>

<p>April 27.—Well, I was out from under rebel guard for an hour
or so any way. Hurt my side though, and caught a little cold. Am
sore somewhat. Have given up the idea of escaping. Think if
Hendryx had been alone he would have gotten away. Is tougher
than I am. A man caught stealing from one of his comrades and
stabbed with a knife and killed. To show how little such things
are noticed here I will give the particulars as near as I could get
them. There were five or six men stopping together in a sort of
shanty. Two of them were speculators, and had some money,
corn bread, &amp;c., and would not divide with their comrades, who
belonged to their own company and regiment. Some time in the
night one of them got up and was stealing bread from a haversack
belonging to his more prosperous neighbor, and during the operation
woke up the owner, who seized a knife and stabbed the poor
fellow dead. The one who did the murder spoke out and said:
“Harry, I believe Bill is dead; he was just stealing from me and I
run my knife into him.” “Good enough for him,” says Harry.
The two men then got up and straightened out “Bill,” and then
both lay down and went to sleep. An occupant of the hut told me
these particulars and they are true. This morning poor Bill lay in
the hut until eight or nine o’clock, and was then carried outside.
The man who did the killing made no secret of it, but told it to all
who wanted to know the particulars, who were only a few, as the
occurrence was not an unusual one.</p>

<p>April 28.—Dr. Lewis is still getting worse with scurvy and dropsy
combined. Limbs swollen to double their usual size—just like
puff-balls. Raiders do about as they please, and their crimes would
fill more paper than I have at my disposal.</p>

<p>April 30.—Very small rations given to us now. Not more than
one-quarter what we want to eat and that of the poorest quality.
Splendid weather, but too warm; occasional rains. The Flying
Dutchman (Wirtz) offers to give any two at a time twelve hours the
start, and if caught to take the punishment he has for runaways.
The offer is made to intimidate those thinking to escape. Half the
men would take the consequences with two hours start.</p>

<p>May 1.—Warm. Samuel Hutton, of the 9th Mich. Cavalry,
died last night; also Peter Christiancy and Joseph Sargent, of Co.
D, 9th Mich., have died within a few weeks. Last evening 700 of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
the 85th New York arrived here. They were taken at Plymouth,
N.C., with 1,400 others, making 2,100 in all. The balance are on
the road to this place. Wrote a letter home to-day. Have not
heard from the North for over six months. Dying off very fast.</p>

<p>May 2.—A crazy man was shot dead by the guard an hour ago.
The guard dropped a piece of bread on the inside of the stockade,
and the fellow went inside the dead line to get it and was killed.
The bread wagon was raided upon as soon as it drove inside to-day
and all the bread stolen, for which offense no more will be issued
to-day. As I write Wirtz is walking about the prison revolver in
hand, cursing and swearing. The men yell out “Hang him up!”
“Kill the Dutch louse!” “Buck and gag him!” “Stone him to
death!” &amp;c., and he all the time trying to find out who it is insulting
him so. “I vish I find out who calls me such insulting vords, I
kill the dam Yankee as soon I eat my supper!” And every few
minutes a handful of dirt is thrown by some one. Wreaks his vengeance
by keeping back rations from the whole camp.</p>

<p>May 3.—A rebel battery came to-day on the cars, and is being
posted around the stockade. Ever since my introduction to Andersonville
they have been constantly at work making their prison
stronger, until now I believe it is impossible for a person to get
away. Notwithstanding, there are men all the time at work in
divers ways. Rebel officers now say that we are not going to be
exchanged during the war, and as they can hold us now and no
fear of escape, they had just as soon tell us the truth as not, and
we must take things just as they see fit to give them to us. Tom
McGill is well and hearty, and as black as any negro. Over 19,000
confined here now, and the death rate ninety or one hundred.</p>

<p>May 4.—Good weather. Gen. Howell Cobb and staff came
among us to-day, and inspected the prison. Wirtz accompanied
them pointing out and explaining matters. Gen. Winder, who has
charge of all the prisoners of war in the South, is here, but has not
been inside. Gen. Cobb is a very large and pompous looking man.
None of the men dare address his highness. Three men out of
every hundred allowed to go out after wood under a strong guard.</p>

<p>May 5.—Cold nights and warm days. Very unhealthy, such
extremes. Small-pox cases carried out, and much alarm felt lest it
should spread.</p>

<p>May 6.—Six months a prisoner to-day. Longer than any six
years of my previous life. It is wonderful how well I stand the
hardships here. At home I was not very robust, in fact had a tendency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
to poor health; but there are not many in prison that stand it
as well as I do. There are about eighty-five or ninety dying now
per day, as near as I can find out. Of course there are stories to the
effect that a hundred and fifty and two hundred die each day, but
such is not the case. Have a code of reasoning that is pretty correct.
Often wonder if I shall get home again, and come to the conclusion
that I shall. My hopeful disposition does more for me than
anything else. Sanders trades and dickers around and makes
extra eatables for our mess. There is not a hog in the mess. Nearly
every day some one is killed for some trifling offense, by the guards.
Rather better food to-day than usual.</p>

<p>May 7.—A squad of Yankees taken outside to-day on parole of
honor, for the purpose of baking meal into bread. George Hendryx
is one of the number, and he will have enough to eat after
this, which I am glad of. I could have gotten outside if I so chose,
but curious to write down I don’t want to go. George says he will
try and send in something for us to eat, and I know he will, for a
truer hearted fellow never lived.</p>

<p>May 8.—Awful warm and more sickly. About 3,500 have died
since I came here, which is a good many, come to think of it—cooked
rations of bread to-day. We get a quarter of a loaf of
bread, weighing about six ounces, and four or five ounces of pork.
These are small allowances, but being cooked it is better for us.
Rebels are making promises of feeding us better, which we hope
they will keep. There is nothing the matter with me now but lack
of food. The scurvy symptoms which appeared a few weeks ago
have all gone.</p>

<p>May 9.—Many rebels riding about camp on horseback. I listened
to an animated conversation between an officer and two of our
men. Mr. Rebel got talked all to pieces and hushed up entirely.
He took it good naturedly, however, and for a wonder did not
swear and curse us. It is a great treat to see a decent rebel. Am
lonesome since Hendryx went outside. Men are continually going
up to the dead line and getting shot. They do not get much
sympathy, as they should know better.</p>

<p>May 10.—Capt. Wirtz very domineering and abusive. Is afraid
to come into camp any more. There are a thousand men in here
who would willingly die if they could kill him first. Certainly the
worst man I ever saw. New prisoners coming in every day with
good clothes, blankets, &amp;c., and occasionally with considerable
money. These are victims for the raiders who pitch into them for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
plunder. Very serious fights occur. Occasionally a party of new
comers stick together and whip the raiders, who afterward rally
their forces and the affair ends with the robbers victorious. Stones,
clubs, knives, sling shots, &amp;c., are used on these occasions, and
sometimes the camp gets so stirred up that the rebels, thinking a
break is intended, fire into the crowds gathered, and many are
killed before quiet is again restored. Then Wirtz writes out an
order and sends inside, telling he is prepared for any break, etc.,
etc. No less than five have died within a radius of thirty feet in
the last twenty-four hours. Hendryx has a sore arm and in turning
over last night I hurt it. He pitched in to me while I was in a
sound sleep to pay me for it. Woke up in short order and we had
it, rough and tumble. Tore down the tent poles—rolled around—scaring
Lewis and all the rest. I am the stoutest, and soon get on
top and hold him down, and keep him there until he quiets down,
which is always in about five minutes. We have squabbles of this
sort often, which don’t do any particular harm. Always laugh,
shake and make up afterwards. The “Astor House Mess,” or the
heads rather, have gently requested that we do our fighting by daylight,
and Sanders very forcibly remarked that should another
scene occur as happened last night, he will take a hand in the business
and lick us both. Battese laughed, for about the first time
this summer. He has taken quite a shine to both Hendryx and
myself. In the fore part of to-day’s entry I should have stated that
Hendryx has been sent inside, they not being quite ready for him
at the cook-house. He is a baker by trade.</p>

<p>May 11.—Rainy weather and cold nights. Men shiver and cry
all night—groan and “holler.” I lay awake sometimes for hours,
listening to the guards yell out “Post number one; ten o’clock and
all’s well!” And then Post No. 2 takes up the refrain, and it goes
all around the camp, every one with a different sounding voice,
squeaky, coarse, and all sorts. Some of them drawl out “H-e-r-e-’s
y-e-r m-u-l-e!” and such like changes, instead of “All’s well.”
Rumors of hard fighting about Richmond, and the rebels getting
whipped, which of course they deny.</p>

<p>May 12.—Received a few lines from George Hendryx, who again
went out to work on the outside last night. Wirtz with a squad of
guards is about the camp looking for tunnels. Patrols also looking
among the prisoners for deserters. A lame man, for telling of
a tunnel, was pounded almost to death last night, and this morning
they were chasing him to administer more punishment, when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
ran inside the dead line claiming protection of the guard. The
guard didn’t protect worth a cent, but shot him through the head.
A general hurrahing took place, as the rebel had only saved our
men the trouble of killing him. More rumors of hard fighting
about Richmond. Grant getting the best of it I reckon. Richmond
surrounded and rebels evacuating the place. These are the
rumors. Guards deny it.</p>

<p>May 13.—Rainy morning. We are guarded by an Alabama regiment,
who are about to leave for the front. Georgia militia to
take their places. Making preparations for a grand pic-nic outside,
given by the citizens of the vicinity to the troops about to leave. I
must here tell a funny affair that has happened to me, which,
although funny is very annoying. Two or three days before I was
captured I bought a pair of cavalry boots of a teamster named
Carpenter. The boots were too small for him and just fitted me.
Promised to pay him on “pay day,” we not having been paid off in
some time. We were both taken prisoners and have been in the
same hundred ever since. Has dunned me now about 1,850 times,
and has always been mad at not getting his pay. Sold the boots
shortly after being captured and gave him half the receipts, and
since that have paid him in rations and money as I could get it,
until about sixty cents remain unpaid, and that sum is a sticker.
He is my evil genius, and fairly haunts the life out of me. Whatever
I may get trusted for in after life, it shall never be for a pair
of boots. Carpenter is now sick with scurvy, and I am beginning
to get the same disease hold of me again. Battese cut my hair
which was about a foot long. Gay old cut. Many have long hair,
which, being never combed, is matted together and full of vermin.
With sunken eyes, blackened countenances from pitch pine smoke,
rags and disease, the men look sickening. The air reeks with nastiness,
and it is wonder that we live at all. When will relief come
to us?</p>

<p>May 14.—A band of music came from Macon yesterday to attend
the pic-nic. A large crowd of women were present to grace the
occasion. The grounds on which the festivities were held lay a
mile off and in sight of all. In the evening a Bowery dance was
one of the pleasures enjoyed. “The Girl I Left Behind Me,” was
about all they could play, and that very poorly.</p>

<p>May 15.—Sabbath day and hot. Would give anything for some
shade to lay in. Even this luxury is denied us, and we are obliged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
to crawl around more dead than alive. Rumors that Sherman is
marching towards Atlanta, and that place threatened. Kilpatrick
said to be moving toward us for the purpose of effecting our release.
Hope he will be more successful than in his attack on Richmond.
Rebels have dug a deep ditch all around on the outside of the wall
to prevent tunneling, and a guard walks in the bottom of the ditch.
Banghart, of my Regiment, died to-day.</p>

<p>May 16.—Two men got away during the night and were brought
back before noon. (Was going to say before dinner.) The men
are torn by the dogs, and one of them full of buck shot. A funny
way of escape has just been discovered by Wirtz. A man pretends
to be dead and is carried out on a stretcher and left with the row of
dead. As soon as it gets dark, Mr. Dead-man jumps up and runs.
Wirtz suspecting the trick took to watching, and discovered a
“dead man” running away. An examination now takes place by
the surgeon before being permitted out from under guard. I hear
a number of men have gotten away by this method, and it seems
very probable, as dead men are so plenty that not much attention
is paid to them.</p>

<p>May 17.—Had a funny dream last night. Thought the rebels
were so hard up for mules that they hitched up a couple of grayback
lice to draw in the bread. Wirtz is watching out for Yankee
tricks. Some one told him the other day that the Yankees were
making a large balloon inside and some day would all rise up in the
air and escape. He flew around as if mad, but could find no signs
of a balloon. Says there is no telling what “te tam Yankee will
do.” Some prisoners came to-day who were captured at Dalton,
and report the place in our possession, and the rebels driven six
miles this side. Kilpatrick and Stoneman are both with Sherman
and there are expectations of starting out on some mission soon,
supposed to be for this place. Nineteen thousand confined here
now and dying at the rate of ninety per day. Philo Lewis, of the
5th Michigan Cav., can live but a day or two. Talks continually
of his wife and family in Ypsilanti, Mich. Has pictures of the
whole family, which he has given me to take home to them, also a
long letter addressed to his wife and children. Mr. Lewis used to
be a teacher of singing in Ypsilanti. He is a fine looking man naturally,
and a smart man, but he must go the way of thousands of
others, and perhaps myself. One of his pupils is here confined.
Philo Lewis must not be confounded with F. L. Lewis, the member
of our mess. The latter, however, cannot live but a short time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
unless relief comes. Fine weather but very warm. The sandy
soil fairly alive with vermin. If this place is so bad at this time of
the year, what must it be in July, August and September? Every
man will die, in my estimation, but perhaps we may be relieved
before then. We’ll try and think so anyway. New prisoners die
off the fastest.</p>

<p>May 18.—We have some good singers in camp, and strange as it
may seem, a good deal of singing is indulged in. There are some
men that are happy as long as they can breathe, and such men
smoothe over many rough places here. God bless a man who can
sing in this place. A priest comes inside praying and chanting.
A good man to come to such a place. Performs his duty the same
to small-pox patients as to any other. Shall try and find out his
name. Some of the wells dug by the Yanks furnish passable water,
an improvement anyway on swamp water. Well water in great
demand and sells readily for such trinkets as the men have to dispose
of. Rebels building forts on the outside. Rebel officers
inside trying to induce shoemakers, foundrymen, carpenters and
wood choppers, to go out and work for the Confederacy. A very
few accepted the offer. Well, life is sweet, and can hardly blame
men for accepting the offer; still, I don’t want to go, neither do
ninety-nine out of every hundred. The soldiers here are loyal to
the cause.</p>

<p>May 19.—Nearly twenty thousand men confined here now. New
ones coming every day. Rations <em>very</em> small and <em>very</em> poor. The
meal that the bread is made out of is ground, seemingly, cob and
all, and it scourges the men fearfully. Things getting continually
worse. Hundreds of cases of dropsy. Men puff out of human
shape and are perfectly horrible to look at. Philo Lewis died to-day.
Could not have weighed at the time of his death more than
ninety pounds, and was originally a large man, weighing not less
than one hundred and seventy. Jack Walker, of the 9th Mich.
Cavalry, has received the appointment to assist in carrying out the
dead, for which service he receives an extra ration of corn bread.</p>

<p>May 20.—Hendryx sent me in to-day from the outside a dozen
small onions and some green tea. No person, on suddenly being
lifted from the lowest depths of misery to peace and plenty, and all
that money could buy, could feel more joyous or grateful than myself
for those things. As the articles were handed in through the
gate a crowd saw the transaction, and it was soon known that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
had a friend on the outside who sent me in extras. I learn that a
conspiracy is being gotten up on the outside, in which Hendryx is
at the head, and they will try and overpower the guard and release
the prisoners. If Capt. Wirtz only knew it, he has a very dangerous
man in George Hendryx. Cram full of adventure, he will be
heard from wherever he is.</p>

<p>May 21.—Still good weather and hot, with damp nights. Dr.
Lewis lingers along in a miserable state of existence, and scurvy
and dropsy doing their worst. His old mess-mates at the 9th Michigan
regimental head-quarters little think of their favorite, story-telling,
good fellows’ condition now. We take as good care of him
as possible under the circumstances. Two men shot to-day by the
barbarians, and one of them has lain all the afternoon where he
fell.</p>

<p>May 22.—No news of importance. Same old story. Am now a
gallant washer-man. Battese, the Minnesota Indian, learn’t me in
the way of his occupation, made me a wash board by cutting creases
in a piece of board, and I am fully installed. We have a sign
out, made by myself on a piece of shingle: “WASHING.” We get
small pieces of bread for our labors. Some of the sick cannot eat
their bread, and not being able to keep clean, give us a job. Make
probably a pound of bread two or three days in the week. Battese
says: “I work, do me good; you do same.” Have many applications
for admission to the firm, and may enlarge the business.</p>

<p>May 23.—Rains very hard. Seems as if the windows of Heaven
had opened up, in fact the windows out all together. It’s a grand
good thing for the camp, as it washes away the filth and purifies
the air.</p>

<p>May 24.—Sherman coming this way, so said, towards Atlanta.
It is thought the cavalry will make a break for us, but even if they
do they cannot get us north. We are equal to no exertion. Men
busy to-day killing swallows that fly low; partly for amusement,
but more particularly for food they furnish. Are eaten raw before
hardly dead. No, thank you, I will take no swallow.</p>

<p>May 25.—One thousand new prisoners came to-day from near
Petersburg, Va. They give us encouraging news as to the termination
of the spring campaign. Gen. Burnside said in a speech to
his men that Petersburg would be taken in less than a month or
Mrs. Burnside would be a widow. Every one hopeful. Getting
warmer after the rain. Our squad has a very good well, and about
one-quarter water enough, of something a trifle better than swamp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
water. Man killed by the raiders near where we slept. Head all
pounded to pieces with a club. Murders an every day occurrence.</p>

<p>May 26.—For the last three days I have had nearly enough to eat
such as it is. My washing business gives me extra food. Have
taken in a partner, and the firm now is Battese, Ransom &amp; Co.
Think of taking in more partners, making Battese president, appointing
vice presidents, secretaries, &amp;c. We charge a ration of
bread for admittance. Sand makes a very good soap. If we could
get hold of a razor and open a barber shop in connection, our fortunes
would be made. We are prolonging Lewis’ life by trading
for luxuries to give him. Occasionally a little real meat soup, with
a piece of onion in it, etc. Am saving up capital to buy a pair of
shears I know of. Molasses given us to-day, from two to four
spoonfuls apiece, which is indeed a treat. Anything sweet or sour,
or in the vegetable line, is the making of us. We have taken to
mixing a little meal with water, putting in a little molasses and
setting it in the sun to sour. Great trouble in the lack of vessels in
which to keep it, and then too, after getting a dish partly well
soured, some poor prisoner will deliberately walk up and before
we can see him drink it all up. Men are fairly crazy for such
things.</p>

<p>May 27.—We twist up pieces of tin, stovepipe, &amp;c., for dishes.
A favorite and common dish is half of a canteen. Our spoons are
made of wood. Hardly one man in ten has a dish of any kind to
put his rations of soup or molasses in, and often old shoes, dirty
caps and the like are brought into requisition. Notwithstanding
my prosperity in business the scurvy is taking right hold of me.
All my old acquaintances visit us daily and we condole with one
another. Fresh beef given us to-day, but in very small quantities
with no wood or salt to put it into proper shape. No one can very
well object to raw beef, however. Great trouble is in getting it to
us before being tainted, I persistently let alone meat with even a
suspicion of rottenness; makes no difference with nearly all here.
We occasionally hear of the conspiracy of outside paroled Yankees.
Time will tell if it amounts to anything.</p>

<p>May 28.—No more news. It really seems as if we’re all to die
here. My mouth getting sore from scurvy and teeth loose. New
prisoners coming in every day and death rate increasing. I don’t
seem to get hardened to the situation and am shuddering all the
time at the sights. Rainy weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>May 29.—Sabbath day but not a pleasant one. Nearly a thousand
just came in. Would seem to me that the rebels are victorious
in their battles. New men are perfectly thunderstruck at the hole
they have got into. A great many give right up and die in a few
weeks, and some in a week. My limbs are badly swollen with
scurvy and dropsy combined. Mouth also very sore. Battese digs
for roots which he steeps up and I drink. Could give up and die
in a short time but won’t. Have got living reduced to a science.</p>

<p>May 30.—Another thousand came to-day and from the eastern
army. Prison crowded. Men who came are from Siegel’s corps
in the Shenandoah Valley. The poor deluded mortals never heard
of Andersonville before. Well, they hear of it now. Charlie
Hudson, from some part of Ohio, took his canteen an hour ago
and went to the swamp for water. He has not returned for the
very good reason that he was shot while reaching up under the
dead line to get the freshest water. Some one has pulled the body
out of the water on to dry land where it will stay until to-morrow,
when it will be piled with perhaps forty others on the dead wagon,
carted off and buried like a dog. And this is the last of poor
Charlie, who has enlivened us many an evening with his songs and
stories. The Astor House Mess is very sad to-night.</p>

<p>May 31.—A rebel came inside to-day and enquired for me, in the
tenth squad, first mess. I responded, wondering and fearful as to
what they should want with me. Was happily surprised on going
to the gate to see Hendryx with something in his hand for me.
Seemed thunderstruck at my appearance and said I was looking
bad. He was looking better than when he went out. Had brought
me luxuries in the shape of ginger bread, onions and tea, and am
happy. Geo. is a brick. Says it is against orders to send anything
inside but he talked them over. Was afraid the raiders
would waylay me before reaching the mess but they did not.</p>

<p>June 1.—Reported that the 51st Virginia Regt. is here for the
purpose of conducting us north for exchange. Believe nothing of
the kind. Prisoners come daily. E. P. Sanders, Rowe and myself
carried our old friend Dr. Lewis to the hospital. He was immediately
admitted and we came away feeling very sad, knowing he
would live but a short time. The sick are not admitted until they
are near death, and then there is no hope for them. Rainy day.</p>

<p>June 2.—Another dark, stormy day. Raiders playing the very
devil. Muddy and sticky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe20" id="i_063">

  <figcaption class="caption">Battese, the Minnesota Indian.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>June 3.—New prisoners say that an armistice has been agreed
upon for the purpose of effecting an exchange, and negotiating for
peace. It may be so, and the authorities had good reasons for
allowing us to stay here, but how can they pay for all the suffering?
And now some negro prisoners brought inside. They belong to
the 54th Massachusetts. Came with white prisoners. Many of the
negroes wounded, as, indeed, there are wounded among all who
come here now. No news from Hendryx or Lewis. Quite a number
going out after wood to cook with. Hot and wet.</p>

<p>June 4.—Have not been dry for many days. Raining continually.
Some men took occasion while out after wood, to overpower
the guard and take to the pines. Not yet been brought back. <em>Very</em>
small rations of poor molasses, corn bread and bug soup.</p>

<p>June 5.—Exchange rumors to the effect that transports are en-route
for Savannah for the purpose of taking us home. Stick right
to my washing however. A number of men taken out to be kept
as hostages—so said. Raiders rule the prison. Am myself cross
and feel like licking somebody, but Hendryx is gone and don’t
want to try to lick anybody else, fearing I might get licked myself.
Some fun fighting him as it didn’t make any difference which
licked.</p>

<p>June 6.—Eight months a prisoner to-day. A lifetime has been
crowded into these eight months. No rations at all. Am now a
hair cutter. Have <em>hired</em> the shears. Enough to eat but not the
right kind. Scurvy putting in its work, and symptoms of dropsy.
Saw Hendryx at the bake house up stairs window, looking over
the camp. Probably looking to see if he can locate his old comrades
among the sea of human beings. Wirtz comes inside no
more, in fact, does very few rebels. The place is too bad for
them.</p>

<p>June 7.—Heard to-day that Hendryx had been arrested and in
irons for inciting a conspiracy. Not much alarmed for him. He
will come out all right. Still rainy. Have hard work keeping my
diary dry. Nearly all the old prisoners who were captured with
me are dead. Don’t know of over 50 or 60 alive out of 800.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>THE ASTOR HOUSE MESS STILL HOLDS TOGETHER, ALTHOUGH DEPLETED—ALL
MORE OR LESS DISEASED—AS THE WEATHER GETS
WARMER THE DEATH RATE INCREASES—DYING OFF LIKE SHEEP—THE
END IS NOT YET.</p>
</div>


<p>June 8.—More new prisoners. There are now over 23,000 confined
here, and the death rate 100 to 130 per day, and I believe
more than that. Rations worse.</p>

<p>June 9.—It is said that a grand break will occur soon, and nearly
the whole prison engaged in the plot. Spies inform the rebels of
our intentions. Rains yet.</p>

<p>June 10.—The whole camp in a blaze of excitement. Plans for
the outbreak known to Capt. Wirtz. Some traitor unfolded the
plans to him. Thirty or forty pieces of artillery pointed at us from
the outside, and stockade covered with guards who shoot right and
left. Thirty or forty outsiders sent inside, and they tell us how the
affair was found out. A number of the ringleaders are undergoing
punishment. Hendryx has made his escape, and not been heard of
since yesterday. It is said he went away in full Confederate dress,
armed, and furnished with a guide to conduct him. Dr. Lewis
died to-day. Jack Walker told us about his death. Capt. Wirtz
has posted up on the inside a notice for us to read. The following
is the notice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p class="center">“NOTICE.</p>

<p>Not wishing to shed the blood of hundreds not connected with
those who concocted a plan to force the stockade, and make in this
way their escape. I hereby warn the leaders and those who formed
themselves into a band to carry out this, that I am in possession of
all the facts, and have made my arrangements accordingly, so to
frustrate it. No choice would be left me but to open with grape
and cannister on the stockade, and what effect this would have in
this densely crowded place need not be told. Signed,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. Wirtz</span>.”</p>
<p>June 10, 1864.</p>
</div>

<p>June 11.—And so has ended a really colossal attempt at escape.
George Hendryx was one of the originators of the plan. He took
advantage of the excitement consequent upon its discovery and
made good his escape, and I hope will succeed in getting to our
lines. It is the same old situation here only worse, and getting
worse all the time. I am not very good at description, and find
myself at fault in writing down the horrible condition we are in.</p>

<p>June 12.—Rained every day so far this month. A portion of the
camp is a mud hole, and the men are obliged to lay down in it.
Fort Pillow prisoners tell some hard stories against the Confederacy
at the treatment they received after their capture. They came
here nearly <em>starved to death</em>, and a good many were wounded after
their surrender. They are mostly Tennesseeans, and a “right smart
sorry set.” Battese has taken quite a fatherly interest in me. Keeps
right on at the head of the washing and hair cutting business, paying
no attention to anything outside of his work. Says: “We get
out all right!”</p>

<p>June 13.—It is now as hot and sultry as it was ever my lot to
witness. The cloudy weather and recent rains make everything
damp and sticky. We don’t any of us sweat though, particularly,
as we are pretty well dried up. Laying on the ground so much has
made sores on nearly every one here, and in many cases gangrene
sets in and they are very bad off. Have many sores on my body,
but am careful to keep away the poison. To-day saw a man with a
bullet hole in his head over an inch deep, and you could look down
in it and see maggots squirming around at the bottom. Such things
are terrible, but of common occurrence. Andersonville seems to be
head-quarters for all the little pests that ever originated—flies by
the thousand millions. I have got into one bad scrape, and the one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
thing now is to get out of it. Can do nothing but take as good care
of myself as possible, which I do. Battese works all the time at
something. Has scrubbed his hands sore, using sand for soap.</p>

<p>June 14.—Mike Hoare stalks around, cheerful, black and hungry.
We have long talks about our school days when little boys together.
Mike is a mason by trade, and was solicited to go out and work for
the rebels. Told them he would work on nothing but vaults to
bury them in. Is a loyal soldier and had rather die here than help
them, as, indeed, would a majority of the prisoners. To tell the
truth, we are so near death and see so much of it, that it is not
dreaded as much as a person would suppose. We stay here day
after day, week after week, and month after month, seemingly forgotten
by all our friends at the North, and then our sufferings are
such that death is a relief in the view of a great many, and not
dreaded to any extent. By four o’clock each day the row of dead
at the gate would scare the life out of me before coming here, while
now it is nothing at all, but the same thing over and over.</p>

<p>June 15.—I am sick; just able to drag around. My teeth are
loose, mouth sore, with gums grown down in some places lower
than the teeth and bloody, legs swollen up with dropsy and on the
road to the trenches. Where there is so much to write about, I can
hardly write anything. It’s the same old story and must necessarily
be repetition. Raiders now do just as they please, kill, plunder
and steal in broad daylight, with no one to molest them. Have
been trying to organize a police force, but cannot do it. Raiders
are the stronger party. Ground covered with maggots. Lice by
the fourteen hundred thousand million infest Andersonville. A
favorite game among the boys is to play at odd or even, by putting
their hand inside some part of their clothing, pull out what they
can conveniently get hold of and say “odd or even?” and then
count up to see who beats. Think this is an original game here,
never saw it at the North. Some of the men claim to have pet lice
which they have trained. Am gradually growing worse. Nothing
but the good care I have taken of myself has saved me thus far. I
hope to last some time yet, and in the meantime relief may come.
My diary about written through. It may end about the same time
I do, which would be a fit ending.</p>

<p>June 16.—Old prisoners (some of them) will not credit the fact
that there is plenty to eat at the North. They think because we are
starved here, that it is so all over. They are crazy (as you may say)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
on the subject of food, and no wonder. In our dreams we see and
eat bountiful repasts, and awake to the other extreme. Never
could get a chance to talk with Capt. Wirtz, as he comes inside no
more. Probably just as well. Is a thoroughly bad man, without
an atom of humanity about him. He will get killed, should we
ever be released, as there are a great many here who would consider
it a christian duty to rid the earth of his presence. Disease is
taking right hold of me now. Battese is an angel; takes better
care of me than of himself. Although not in our mess or tent, he
is nearly all the time with us. It is wonderful the powers of endurance
he has. I have always been blessed with friends, and friends,
too, of the right sort. Had quite a talk with Dorr Blakeman, a
Jackson, Mich., boy. Was not much acquainted with him at home
but knew his people. Is a thoroughly good fellow, and a sensible
one. It is a relief to see any one who does not lose his head.</p>

<p>June 17.—Must nurse my writing material. A New York <cite>Herald</cite>
in camp, which says an exchange will commence the 7th of July.
Gen. Winder is on a visit to Andersonville. Is quite an aged man,
and white haired. Very warm and almost suffocating. Seems as
if the sun was right after us and belonged to the Confederacy.
Chas. Humphrey, of Massachusetts, who has been in our hundred
for months, has gone crazy; wanders about entirely naked, and not
even a cap on his head. Many of the prisoners are crazy, and I
only speak of those in our immediate proximity. Am in good spirits,
notwithstanding my afflictions. Have never really thought yet
that I was going to die in this place or in the Confederacy. Saw a
newcomer pounded to a jelly by the raiders. His cries for relief
were <em>awful</em>, but none came. Must a few villains live at the expense
of so many? God help us from these worse than rebels.</p>

<p>June 18.—Have now written two large books full; have another
at hand. New prisoners who come here have diaries which they
will sell for a piece of bread. No news to-day. Dying off as usual—more
in numbers each day as the summer advances. Rebels say
that they don’t begin to have hot weather down here until about
August. Well, it is plain to me that all will die. Old prisoners
have stood it as long as they can, and are dropping off fast, while
the new ones go anyhow. Some one stole my cap during the night.
A dead neighbor furnished me with another, however. Fast as the
men die they are stripped of their clothing so that those alive can
be covered. Pretty hard, but the best we can do. Rebels are anxious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
to get hold of Yankee buttons. “Buttons with hens on,” they
enquire for. An insult to the American Eagle—but they don’t
know any better.</p>

<p>June 19.—A young fellow named Conely tramps around the prison
with ball and chain on. His crime was trying to get away. I
say he tramps around, he tramps away from the gate with it on at
nine in the morning, and as soon as out of sight of the rebels he
takes it off, and only puts it on at nine o’clock the next morning to
report at the gate duly ironed off. They think, of course, that he
wears it all the time. Jimmy Devers looks and is in a very bad
way. Too bad if the poor fellow should die now, after being a
prisoner almost a year. Talks a great deal about his younger brother
in Jackson, named Willie. Says if he should die to be sure
and tell Willie not to drink, which has been one of Jimmy’s failings,
and he sees now what a foolish habit it is. Michael Hoare stands
it well. When a man is shot now it is called being “parolled.”</p>

<p>June 20.—All the mess slowly but none the less surely succumbing
to the diseases incident here. We are not what you may call
hungry. I have actually felt the pangs of hunger more when I was
a boy going home from school to dinner. But we are sick and faint
and all broken down, feverish &amp;c. It is starvation and disease and
exposure that is doing it. Our stomachs have been so abused by
the stuff called bread and soups, that they are diseased. The bread
is coarse and musty. Believe that half in camp would die now if
given rich food to eat.</p>

<p>June 21.—I am a fair writer, and am besieged by men to write
letters to the rebel officers praying for release, and I do it, knowing
it will do no good, but to please the sufferers. Some of these letters
are directed to Capt. Wirtz, some to Gen. Winder, Jeff Davis
and other officers. As dictated by them some would bring tears
from a stone. One goes on to say he has been a prisoner of war over
a year, has a wife and three children destitute, how much he thinks
of them, is dying with disease, etc., etc. All kinds of stories are
narrated, and handed to the first rebel who comes within reach.
Of course they are never heard from. It’s pitiful to see the poor
wretches who think their letters will get them out, watch the gate
from day to day, and always disappointed. Some one has much to
answer for.</p>

<p>June 22.—The washing business progresses and is prosperous.
One great trouble is, it is run too loose and we often get no pay.
Battese, while a good worker, is no business man, and will do anybody’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
washing on promises, which don’t amount to much. Am not
able to do much myself, principally hanging out the clothes; that
is, laying the shirt on one of the tent poles and then watching it till
dry. All day yesterday I lay under the “coverlid” in the shade,
hanging on to a string which was tied to the washing. If I saw a
suspicious looking chap hanging around with his eyes on the
washed goods, then gave a quick jerk and in she comes out of
harm’s way. Battese has paid for three or four shirts lost in this
way, and one pair of pants. Pays in bread. A great many Irish
here, and as a class, they stand hardships well. Jimmy Devers
losing heart and thinks he will die. Capt. Wirtz has issued another
order, but don’t know what it is—to the effect that raiding and killing
must be stopped, I believe. Being unable to get around as I
used to, do not hear the particulars of what is going on, only in a
general way. New men coming in, and bodies carried out. Is
there no end but dying?</p>

<p>June 23.—My coverlid nobly does duty, protecting us from the
sun’s hot rays by day and the heavy dews at night. Have no doubt
but it has saved my life many times. Never have heard anything
from Hendryx since his escape. Either got away to our lines or
shot. Rebels recruiting among us for men to put in their ranks.
None will go—yes, I believe one Duffy has gone with them. Much
fighting. Men will fight as long as they can stand up. A father
fights his own son not ten rods from us. Hardly any are strong
enough to do much damage except the raiders, who get enough to
eat and are in better condition than the rest. Four or five letters
were delivered to their owners. Were from their homes. Remarkable,
as I believe this is the first mail since our first coming here.
Something wrong. Just shake in my boots—shoes, I mean, (plenty
of room) when I think what July and August will do for us. Does
not seem to me as if any can stand it. After all, it’s hard killing a
man. Can stand most anything.</p>

<p>June 24.—Almost July 1st, when Jimmy Devers will have been a
prisoner of war one year. Unless relief comes very soon he will
die. I have read in my earlier years about prisoners in the revolutionary
war, and other wars. It sounded noble and heroic to be a
prisoner of war, and accounts of their adventures were quite romantic;
but the romance has been knocked out of the prisoner of war
business, higher than a kite. It’s a fraud. All of the “Astor
House Mess” now afflicted with scurvy and dropsy more or less,
with the exception of Battese, and myself worst of any. Am fighting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
the disease, however, all the time, and the growth is but slight.
Take exercise every morning and evening, when it is almost impossible
for me to walk. Walk all over before the sun comes up,
drink of Battese’s medicine made of roots, keep clear of vermin,
talk and even laugh, and if I do die, it will not be through neglect.
Carpenter, the teamster who sold me the boots, is about gone, and
thank the Lord he has received his sixty cents from me, in rations.
Sorry for the poor fellow. Many who have all along stood it nobly
now begin to go under. Wm. B. Rowe, our tall mess-mate, is quite
bad off, still, he has an iron constitution and will last some time
yet.</p>

<p>June 25.—Another lead pencil wore down to less than an inch in
length, and must skirmish around for another one. New men
bring in writing material and pencils. To-day saw a New York
<cite>Herald</cite> of date June 11th, nothing in it about exchange, however.
That is all the news that particularly interests us, although accounts
of recent battles are favorable to the Union side. Our guards are
composed of the lowest element of the South—poor white trash.
Very ignorant, much more so than the negro. Some of them act as
if they never saw a gun before. The rebel adjutant does quite a
business selling vegetables to those of the prisoners who have money,
and has established a sutler stand not very far from our mess.
Hub Dakin, an old acquaintance, is a sort of clerk, and gets enough
to eat thereby. Hot! Hot! Raiders kill some one now every day.
No restraint in the least. Men who were no doubt respectable at
home, are now the worst villains in the world. One of them was
sneaking about our quarters during the night, and Sanders knocked
him about ten feet with a board. Some one of us must keep awake
all the time, and on the watch, fearing to loose what little we have.</p>

<p>June 26.—The same old story, only worse, worse. It seems all
the time it was as bad as could be, but is not. They die now like
sheep—fully a hundred each day. New prisoners come inside in
squads of hundreds, and in a few weeks are <em>all dead</em>. The change
is too great and sudden for them. Old prisoners stand it the best.
Found a Jackson, Michigan man, who says I am reported dead
there. Am not, however, and may appear to them yet. Jimmy
Devers is very bad with the scurvy and dropsy and will probably
die if relief does not come. Sergt. Rowe also is afflicted; in fact all
the mess except Battese. He does all the cooking now. He has
made me a cane to walk with, brings water from the well, and performs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
nearly all the manual labor for us. He is a jewel, but a
rough one.</p>

<p>June 27.—Raiders going on worse than ever before. A perfect
pandemonium. Something must be done, and that quickly. There
is danger enough from disease, without being killed by raiders.
Any moment fifty or a hundred of them are liable to pounce upon
our mess, knock right and left and take the very clothing off our
backs. No one is safe from them. It is hoped that the more peaceable
sort will rise in their might and put them down. Our misery
is certainly complete without this trouble added to it. We should
die in peace anyway. Battese has called his Indian friends all together,
and probably a hundred of us are banded together for self
protection. The animal predominates. All restraint is thrown off
and the very Old Harry is to pay. The farther advanced the summer,
the death rate increases, until they die off by scores. I walk
around to see friends of a few days ago and am told “dead.” Men
stand it nobly and are apparently ordinarily well, when all at once
they go. Like a horse, that will stand up until he drops dead.
Some of the most horrible sights that can possibly be, are common
every day occurrances. See men laying all around in the last
struggles.</p>

<p>June 28.—It seems to me as if three times as many as ever before
are now going off, still I am told that about one hundred and thirty
die per day. The reason it seems worse, is because no sick are
being taken out now, and they all die here instead of at the hospital.
Can see the dead wagon loaded up with twenty or thirty
bodies at a time, two lengths, just like four foot wood is loaded on
to a wagon at the North, and away they go to the grave yard on a
trot. Perhaps one or two will fall off and get run over. No attention
paid to that; they are picked up on the road back after more.
Was ever before in this world anything so terrible happening?
Many entirely naked.</p>

<p>June 29.—Capt. Wirtz sent inside a guard of fifteen or twenty to
arrest and take out quite a number of prisoners. They had the
names and would go right to their quarters and take them. Some
tell-tale traitor has been informing on them, for attempting to
escape or something. Wirtz punishes very hard now; so much
worse than a few months ago. Has numerous instruments of torture
just outside the gate. Sores afflict us now, and the Lord only
knows what next. Scurvy and scurvy sores, dropsy, not the least
thing to eat that can be called fit for any one, much less a sick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
man, water that to drink is poison, no shelter, and surrounded by
raiders liable to cut our throats any time. Surely, this is a go.
Have been reading over the diary, and find nothing but grumbling
and growlings. Had best enumerate some of the better things of
this life. I am able to walk around the prison, although quite
lame. Have black pepper to put in our soups. Am as clean perhaps
as any here, with good friends to talk cheerful to. Then, too,
the raiders will let us alone until about the last, for some of them
will get killed when they attack the “Astor House Mess.” Am
probably as well off as any here who are not raiders, and I should
be thankful, and am thankful. Will live probably two or three
months yet. “If t’weren’t for hope the heart would break,” and I
am hopeful yet. A Pennsylvanian of German descent, named Van
Tassel, and who has “sorter identified himself with us” for two or
three months, died a few moments ago. The worst cases of the
sick are again taken to the hospital—that is, a few of the worst
cases. Many prefer to die among their friends inside. Henry
Clayton also died to-day. Was at one time in charge of our Division,
and an old prisoner. Mike Hoare still hangs on nobly, as also
do many other of my friends and acquaintances. Dorr Blakeman
stands it unusually well. Have had no meat now for ten days;
nothing but one-third of a loaf of corn bread and half a pint of cow
peas for each man, each day. Wood is entirely gone, and occasionally
squads allowed to go and get some under guard. Rowe went
out to-day, was not able to carry much, and that had to be divided
between a hundred men. One of the most annoying things is being
squadded over every few days, sick and all. It’s an all day job,
and have to stand out until we are all tired out, never getting any
food on these days.</p>

<p>June 30.—A new prisoner fainted away on his entrance to Andersonville
and is now crazy, a raving maniac. That is how our
condition affected him. My pants are the worse for wear from
repeated washings, my shirt sleeveless and feet stockingless; have
a red cap without any front piece; shoes by some hocus-pocus are
not mates, one considerable larger than the other. Wonder what
they would think if I should suddenly appear on the streets in
Jackson in this garb. Would be a circus; side show and all. But
nights I have a grand old coverlid to keep off the wet. Raiders
steal blankets and sell to the guards, which leaves all nearly destitute
of that very necessary article. Often tell how I got my coverlid,
to visitors. Have been peddling pea soup on the streets: “Ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
cents in money or a dollar Confed for this rich soup! Who takes
it?” And some wretch buys it. Anything in the way of food will
sell, or water, if different from swamp water. Rebs making a
pretense of fixing up sanitary privileges at the swamp, which
amount to nothing. Strong talk of forming a police force to put
down raiders and to enforce order. If successful it will prove of
great benefit. Sanders, Rowe, Blakeman, Dakin and myself are
among those who will take an active part, although the part I take
cannot be very active. Half a dozen letters sent inside to prisoners,
but no news in them that I can hear of. More hot and sultry,
with occasional rains. The crazy man says nothing but “prayer”
will save us. He has been sucking a bone now for about two weeks
and pays more attention to that than to prayer.</p>

<p>July 1.—Matters must approach a crisis pretty soon with the
raiders. It is said that even the rebels are scared and think they
will have no prisoners, should an exchange ever occur. John
Bowen, a Corp. Christency, Hemmingway, Byron Goodsell and
Pete Smith, old acquaintances, have all died within a few days.
Jimmy Devers still lives, with wonderful tenacity to life. To-morrow
he will have been a prisoner of war a year. Mike Hoare still
keeps very well, but the most comical looking genius in the whole
prison. Could make a fortune out of him on exhibition at the
North. He says I look worse however. That may be, but not so
comical. It’s tragedy with the most of us. New guards are taking
the place of the old ones, and it is said that Wirtz is going away.
Hope so. Never have heard one word from Hendryx since his
getting away. Sanders is trying to get outside as a butcher. He
understands the business. “Dad” has been to Australia, and has
told us all about that country. Have also heard all about Ireland
and Scotland. Should judge they were fine countries. Rowe has
been telling me of the advantage of silk under clothing, and in
addition to visiting all the foreign countries, we shall have silk
under wear. Rowe once lived in Boston, and I shall likewise go
there.</p>

<p>July 2.—Almost the Glorious Fourth of July. How shall we
celebrate? Know of no way except to pound on the bake tin,
which I shall do. Have taken to rubbing my limbs, which are
gradually becoming more dropsical. Badly swollen. One of my
teeth came out a few days ago, and all are loose. Mouth very
sore. Battese says: “We get away yet.” Works around and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
always busy. If any news, he merely listens and don’t say a word.
Even he is in poor health, but never mentions it. An acquaintance
of his says he owns a good farm in Minnesota. Asked him if he
was married—says: “Oh, yes.” Any children? “Oh, yes.” This
is as far as we have got his history. Is very different from Indians
in general. Some of them here are despisable cowards—worse
than the negro. Probably one hundred negroes are here. Not so
tough as the whites. Dead line being fixed up by the rebels. Got
down in some places. Bought a piece of soap, first I have seen in
many months. Swamp now in frightful condition from the filth of
camp. Vermin and raiders have the best of it. Capt. Moseby still
leads the villains.</p>

</div>


<p>July 3.—Three hundred and fifty new men from West Virginia
were turned into this summer resort this morning. They brought
good news as to successful termination of the war, and they also
caused war after coming among us. As usual the raiders proceeded
to rob them of their valuables and a fight occurred in which
hundreds were engaged. The cut-throats came out ahead. Complaints
were made to Capt. Wirtz that this thing would be tolerated
no longer, that these raiders must be put down or the men would
rise in their might and break away if assistance was not given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
with which to preserve order. Wirtz flew around as if he
had never thought of it before, issued an order to the effect that
no more food would be given us until the leaders were arrested
and taken outside for trial. The greatest possible excitement.
Hundreds that have before been neutral and non-commital are now
joining a police force. Captains are appointed to take charge of
the squads which have been furnished with clubs by Wirtz. As I
write, this middle of the afternoon, the battle rages. The police go
right to raider head-quarters knock right and left and make their
arrests. Sometimes the police are whipped and have to retreat,
but they rally their forces and again make a charge in which they
are successful. Can lay in our shade and see the trouble go on.
Must be killing some by the shouting. The raiders fight for their
very life, and are only taken after being thoroughly whipped.
The stockade is loaded with guards who are fearful of a break. I
wish I could describe the scene to-day. A number killed. After
each arrest a great cheering takes place. <span class="smcap">Night.</span>—Thirty or forty
have been taken outside of the worst characters in camp, and still
the good work goes on. No food to-day and don’t want any. A
big strapping fellow called Limber Jim heads the police. Grand
old Michael Hoare is at the front and goes for a raider as quick as
he would a rebel. Patrol the camp all the time and gradually
quieting down. The orderly prisoners are feeling jolly.</p>

<p>July 4.—The men taken outside yesterday are under rebel guard
and will be punished. The men are thoroughly aroused, and now
that the matter has been taken in hand, it will be followed up to
the letter. Other arrests are being made to-day, and occasionally a
big fight. Little Terry, whom they could not find yesterday, was
to-day taken. Had been hiding in an old well, or hole in the
ground. Fought like a little tiger, but had to go. “Limber Jim”
is a brick, and should be made a Major General if he ever reaches
our lines. Mike Hoare is right up in rank, and true blue. Wm.
B. Rowe also makes a good policeman, as does “Dad” Sanders.
Battese says he “no time to fight, must wash.” Jimmy Devers
regrets that he cannot take a hand in, as he likes to fight, and especially
with a club. The writer hereof does no fighting, being on
the sick list. The excitement of looking on is most too much for
me. Can hardly arrest the big graybacks crawling around. Capt.
Moseby is one of the arrested ones. His right name is Collins and
he has been in our hundred all the time since leaving Richmond.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
Has got a good long neck to stretch. Another man whom I have
seen a good deal of, one Curtiss, is also arrested. I haven’t mentioned
poor little Bullock for months, seems to me. He was most
dead when we first came to Andersonville, and is still alive and
tottering around. Has lost his voice entirely and is nothing but a
skeleton. Hardly enough of him for disease to get hold of. Would
be one of the surprising things on record if he lives through it, and
he seems no worse than months ago. It is said that a court will be
formed of our own men to try the raiders. Any way, so they are
punished. All have killed men, and they themselves should be
killed. When arrested, the police had hard work to prevent their
being lynched. Police more thoroughly organizing all the time.
An extra amount of food this <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, and police get extra rations,
and three out of our mess is doing pretty well, as they are all willing
to divide. They tell us all the encounters they have, and
much interesting talk. Mike has some queer experiences. Rebel
flags at half mast for some of their great men. Just heard that the
trial of raiders will begin to-morrow.</p>

<p>July 5.—Court is in session outside and raiders being tried by
our own men. Wirtz has done one good thing, but it’s a question
whether he is entitled to any credit, as he had to be threatened
with a break before he would assist us. Rations again to-day. I
am quite bad off with my diseases, but still there are so many thousands
so much worse off that I do not complain much, or try not
to however.</p>

<p>July 6.—Boiling hot, camp reeking with filth, and no sanitary
privileges; men dying off over a hundred and forty per day. Stockade
enlarged, taking in eight or ten more acres, giving us more
room, and stumps to dig up for wood to cook with. Mike Hoare
is in good health; not so Jimmy Devers. Jimmy has now been a
prisoner over a year, and poor boy, will probably die soon. Have
more mementoes than I can carry, from those who have died, to
be given to their friends at home. At least a dozen have given me
letters, pictures &amp;c., to take North. Hope I shan’t have to turn
them over to some one else.</p>

<p>July 7.—The court was gotten up by our own men and from our
own men; Judge, jury, counsel, &amp;c. Had a fair trial, and were
even defended, but to no purpose. It is reported that six have
been sentenced to be hung, while a good many others are condemned
to lighter punishment, such as setting in the stocks, strung
up by the thumbs, thumb screws, head hanging, etc. The court<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
has been severe, but just. Mike goes out to-morrow to take some
part in the court proceedings. The prison seems a different place
altogether; still, dread disease is here, and mowing down good and
true men. Would seem to me that three or four hundred died each
day, though officially but one hundred and forty odd is told. About
twenty-seven thousand, I believe, are here now in all. No new ones
for a few days. Rebel visitors, who look at us from a distance.
It is said the stench keeps all away who have no business here and
can keep away. Washing business good. Am negotiating for a
pair of pants. Dislike fearfully to wear dead men’s clothes, and
haven’t to any great extent.</p>

<p>July 8.—Oh, how hot, and oh, how miserable. The news that
six have been sentenced to be hanged is true, and one of them is
Moseby. The camp is thoroughly under control of the police now,
and it is a heavenly boon. Of course there is some stealing and
robbery, but not as before. Swan, of our mess, is sick with scurvy.
I am gradually swelling up and growing weaker. But a few more
pages in my diary. Over a hundred and fifty dying per day now,
and twenty-six thousand in camp. Guards shoot now very often.
Boys, as guards, are the most cruel. It is said that if they kill a
Yankee, they are given a thirty days furlough. Guess they need
them as soldiers too much to allow of this. The swamp now is fearful,
water perfectly reeking with prison offal and poison. Still men
drink it and die. Rumors that the six will be hung inside. Bread
to-day and it is so coarse as to do more hurt than good to a majority
of the prisoners. The place still gets worse. Tunneling is over
with; no one engages in it now that I know of. The prison is a
success as regards safety; no escape except by death, and very
many take advantage of that way. A man who has preached to us
(or tried to) is dead. Was a good man I verily believe, and from
Pennsylvania. It’s almost impossible for me to get correct names
to note down; the last named man was called “the preacher,” and
I can find no other name for him. Our quartette of singers a few
rods away is disbanded. One died, one nearly dead, one a policeman
and the other cannot sing alone, and so where we used to hear
and enjoy good music evenings, there is nothing to attract us from
the groans of the dying. Having formed a habit of going to sleep
as soon as the air got cooled off and before fairly dark, I wake up
at two or three o’clock and stay awake. I then take in all the horrors
of the situation. Thousands are groaning, moaning and crying,
with no bustle of the day time to drown it. Guards every half
hour call out the time and post, and there is often a shot to make
one shiver as if with the ague. Must arrange my sleeping hours to
miss getting owly in the morning. Have taken to building air
castles of late, on being exchanged. Getting loony, I guess, same
as all the rest.</p>

<p>July 9.—Battese brought me some onions, and if they ain’t good
then no matter; also a sweet potato. One-half the men here would
get well if they only had something in the vegetable line to eat, or
acids. Scurvy is about the most loathsome disease, and when
dropsy takes hold with the scurvy, it is terrible. I have both diseases
but keep them in check, and it only grows worse slowly. My
legs are swollen, but the cords are not contracted much, and I can
still walk very well. Our mess all keep clean, in fact are obliged
to or else turned adrift. We want none of the dirty sort in our
mess. Sanders and Rowe enforce the rules, which is not much
work, as all hands are composed of men who prefer to keep clean.
I still do a little washing, but more particularly hair cutting, which
is easier work. You should see one of my hair cuts. Nobby! Old
prisoners have hair a foot long or more, and my business is to cut
it off, which I do without regards to anything except to get it off.
I should judge that there are one thousand rebel soldiers guarding
us, and perhaps a few more, with the usual number of officers. A
guard told me to-day that the yanks were “gittin licked,” and
they didn’t want us exchanged; just as soon we should die here as
not; a yank asked him if he knew what exchange meant; said he
knew what shootin’ meant, and as he began to swing around his
old shooting iron we retreated in among the crowd. Heard that
there were some new men belonging to my regiment in another
part of the prison; have just returned from looking after them
and am all tired out. Instead of belonging to the 9th Michigan
Cavalry, they belong to the 9th Michigan Infantry. Had a good
visit and quite cheered with their accounts of the war news. Some
one stole Battese’s wash board and he is mad; is looking for it—may
bust up the business. Think Hub Dakin will give me a board to
make another one. Sanders owns the jack knife, of this mess, and
he don’t like to lend it either; borrow it to carve on roots for pipes.
Actually take solid comfort “building castles in the air,” a thing I
have never been addicted to before. Better than getting blue and
worrying myself to death. After all, we may get out of this dod-rotted
hole. Always an end of some sort to such things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>July 10.—Have bought of a new prisoner quite a large (thick I
mean,) blank book so as to continue my diary. Although it’s a
tedious and tiresome task, am determined to keep it up. Don’t
know of another man in prison who is doing likewise. Wish I had
the gift of description that I might describe this place. Know that
I am not good at such things, and have more particularly kept track
of the mess which was the “Astor House Mess” on Belle Isle, and
is still called so here. Thought that Belle Isle was a very bad place,
and used about the worst language I knew how to use in describing
it, and so find myself at fault in depicting matters here as they
are. At Belle Isle we had good water and plenty of it, and I believe
it depends more upon water than food as regards health. We
also had good pure air from up the James River. Here we have
the very worst kind of water. Nothing can be worse or nastier
than the stream drizzling its way through this camp. And for air
to breathe, it is what arises from this foul place. On all four sides
of us are high walls and tall trees, and there is apparently no wind
or breeze to blow away the stench, and we are obliged to breathe
and live in it. Dead bodies lay around all day in the broiling sun,
by the dozen and even hundreds, and we must suffer and live in
this atmosphere. It’s too horrible for me to describe in fitting language.
There was once a very profane man driving a team of
horses attached to a wagon in which there were forty or fifty bushels
of potatoes. It was a big load and there was a long hill to go
up. The very profane man got off the load of potatoes to lighten
the weight, and started the team up the hill. It was hard work,
but they finally reached the top and stopped to rest. The profane
man looked behind him and saw that the end board of the wagon
had slipped out just as he had started, and there the potatoes were,
scattered all the way along up the hill. Did the man make the
very air blue with profanity? No, he sat down on a log feeling
that he couldn’t do the subject justice and so he remarked: “No!
it’s no use, I can’t do it justice.” While I have no reason or desire
to swear, I certainly cannot do this prison justice. It’s too stupenduous
an undertaking. Only those who are here will ever know
what Andersonville is.</p>


<p class="p1 center">AN ACCOUNT OF THE HANGING.</p>

<p>July 11.—This morning lumber was brought into the prison by
the rebels, and near the gate a <em>gallows</em> erected for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
executing the six condemned Yankees. At about ten o’clock they
were brought inside by Capt. Wirtz and some guards, and delivered
over to the police force. Capt. Wirtz then said a few words about
their having been tried by our own men and for us to do as we
choose with them, that he washed his hands of the whole matter,
or words to that effect. I could not catch the exact language,
being some little distance away. I have learned by enquiry, their
names, which are as follows: John Sarsfield, 144th New York;
William Collins, alias “Moseby,” Co. D, 88th Pennsylvania;
Charles Curtiss, Battery A, 5th Rhode Island Artillery; Pat Delaney,
Co. E, 83d Pennsylvania; A. Munn, U. S. Navy, and W. R.
Rickson of the U. S. Navy. After Wirtz made his speech he withdrew
his guards, leaving the condemned at the mercy of 28,000
enraged prisoners who had all been more or less wronged by these
men. Their hands were tied behind them, and one by one they
mounted the scaffold. Curtiss, who was last, a big stout fellow,
managed to get his hands loose and broke away and ran through
the crowd and down toward the swamp. It was yelled out that he
had a knife in his hand, and so a path was made for him. He
reached the swamp and plunged in, trying to get over on the other
side, presumably among his friends. It being very warm he over
exerted himself, and when in the middle or thereabouts, collapsed
and could go no farther. The police started after him, waded in
and helped him out. He pleaded for water and it was given him.
Then led back to the scaffold and helped to mount up. All were
given a chance to talk. Munn, a good looking fellow in marine
dress, said he came into the prison four months before perfectly
honest, and as innocent of crime as any fellow in it. Starvation,
with evil companions, had made him what he was. He spoke of
his mother and sisters in New York, that he cared nothing as far
as he himself was concerned, but the news that would be carried
home to his people made him want to curse God he had ever been
born. Delaney said he would rather be hung than live here as the
most of them lived, on their allowance of rations. If allowed to
steal could get enough to eat, but as that was stopped had rather
hang. Bid all good bye. Said his name was not Delaney and that
no one knew who he really was, therefore his friends would never
know his fate, his Andersonville history dying with him. Curtiss
said he didn’t care a ——, only hurry up and not be talking about
it all day; making too much fuss over a very small matter. William
Collins, alias Moseby, said he was innocent of murder and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
ought not to be hung; he had stolen blankets and rations to preserve
his own life, and begged the crowd not to see him hung as
he had a wife and child at home, and for their sake to let him live.
The excited crowd began to be impatient for the “show” to commence
as they termed it. Sarsfield made quite a speech; he had
studied for a lawyer; at the outbreak of the rebellion he had enlisted
and served three years in the army, been wounded in battle,
furloughed home, wound healed up, promoted to first sergeant and
also commissioned; his commission as a lieutenant had arrived but
had not been mustered in when he was taken prisoner; began by
stealing parts of rations, gradually becoming hardened as he became
familiar with the crimes practiced; evil associates had helped
him to go down hill and here he was. The other did not care to
say anything. While the men were talking they were interrupted
by all kinds of questions and charges made by the crowd, such as
“don’t lay it on too thick, you villain,” “get ready to jump off,”
“cut it short,” “you was the cause of so and so’s death,” “less
talk and more hanging,” &amp;c., &amp;c. At about eleven o’clock they
were all blindfolded, hands and feet tied, told to get ready, nooses
adjusted and the plank knocked from under. Moseby’s rope broke
and he fell to the ground, with blood spurting from his ears, mouth
and nose. As they was lifting him back to the swinging off place
he revived and begged for his life, but no use, was soon dangling
with the rest, and died very hard. Munn died easily, as also did
Delaney, all the rest died hard and particularly Sarsfield who
drew his knees nearly to his chin and then straightened them out
with a jerk, the veins in his neck swelling out as if they would
burst. It was an awful sight to see, still a necessity. Moseby,
although he said he had never killed any one, and I don’t believe
he ever did deliberately kill a man, such as stabbing or pounding a
victim to death, yet he has walked up to a poor sick prisoner on a
cold night and robbed him of blanket, or perhaps his rations and if
necessary using all the force necessary to do it. These things
were the same as life to the sick man, for he would invariably die.
The result has been that many have died from his robbing propensities.
It was right that he should hang, and he did hang most
beautifully and Andersonville is the better off for it. None of the
rest denied that they had killed men, and probably some had murdered
dozens. It has been a good lesson; there are still bad ones
in camp but we have the strong arm of the law to keep them in
check. All during the hanging scene the stockade was covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
with rebels, who were fearful a break would be made if the raiders
should try and rescue them. Many citizens too were congregated
on the outside in favorable positions for seeing. Artillery
was pointed at us from all directions ready to blow us all into
eternity in short order; Wirtz stood on a high platform in plain
sight of the execution and says we are a hard crowd to kill our own
men. After hanging for half an hour or so the six bodies were taken
down and carried outside. In noting down the speeches made
by the condemned men, have used my own language; in substance
it is the same as told by them. I occupied a near position to the
hanging and saw it all from first to last, and stood there until they
were taken down and carried away. Was a strange sight to see
and the first hanging I ever witnessed. The raiders had many
friends who crowded around and denounced the whole affair and
but for the police there would have been a riot; many both for and
against the execution were knocked down. Some will talk and get
into trouble thereby; as long as it does no good there is no use in
loud talk and exciting arguments; is dangerous to advance any argument,
men are so ready to quarrel. Have got back to my quarters
thoroughly prostrated and worn out with fatigue and excitement,
and only hope that to-day’s lesson will right matters as regards
raiding. Battese suspended washing long enough to look on
and see them hang and grunted his approval. Have omitted to say
that the good Catholic priest attended the condemned. Rebel negroes
came inside and began to take down the scaffold; prisoners
took hold to help them and resulted in its all being carried off to
different parts of the prison to be used for kindling wood, and the
rebels get none of it back and are mad. The ropes even have been
gobbled up, and I suppose sometime may be exhibited at the north
as mementoes of to-day’s proceedings. Mike Hoare assisted at the
hanging. Some fears are entertained that those who officiated will
get killed by the friends of those hanged. The person who manipulated
the “drop,” has been taken outside on parole of honor, as
his life would be in danger in here. Jimmy thanks God that he
has lived to see justice done the raiders; he is about gone—nothing
but skin and bone and can hardly move hand or foot; rest of the
mess moderately well. The extra rations derived from our three
mess-mates as policemen, helps wonderfully to prolong life. Once
in a while some of them gets a chance to go outside on some duty
and buy onions or sweet potatoes which is a great luxury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>July 12.—Good order has prevailed since the hanging. The men
have settled right down to the business of living, with no interruption.
I keep thinking our situation can get no worse, but it does
get worse every day and not less than one hundred and sixty die
each twenty-four hours. Probably one-fourth or one-third of these
die inside the stockade, the balance in the hospital outside. All day
and up to four o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, the dead are being gathered up and
carried to the south gate and placed in a row inside the dead line.
As the bodies are stripped of their clothing in most cases as soon as
the breath leaves, and in some cases before, the row of dead presents
a sickening appearance. Legs drawn up and in all shapes.
They are black from pitch pine smoke and laying in the sun. Some
of them lay there for twenty hours or more, and by that time are
in a horrible condition. At four o’clock a four or six mule wagon
comes up to the gate and twenty or thirty bodies are loaded on to
the wagon and they are carted off to be put in trenches, one hundred
in each trench, in the cemetery, which is eighty or a hundred
rods away. There must necessarily be a great many whose names
are not taken. It is the orders to attach the name, company and
regiment to each body, but it is not always done. I was invited to-day
to dig in a tunnel, but had to decline. My digging days are
over. Must dig now to keep out of the ground, I guess. It is with
difficulty now that I can walk, and only with the help of two
canes.</p>

<p>July 13.—Can see in the distance the cars go poking along by
this station, with wheezing old engines, snorting along. As soon
as night comes a great many are blind, caused by sleeping in the
open air, with moon shining in the face. Many holes are dug and
excavations made in camp. Near our quarters is a well about five
or six feet deep, and the poor blind fellows fall into this pit hole.
None seriously hurt, but must be quite shaken up. Half of the
prisoners have no settled place for sleeping, wander and lay down
wherever they can find room. Have two small gold rings on my
finger, worn ever since I left home. Have also a small photograph
album with eight photographs in. Relics of civilization. Should
I get these things through to our lines they will have quite a history.
When I am among the rebels I wind a rag around my finger
to cover up the rings, or else take them and put in my pocket. Bad
off as I have been, have never seen the time yet that I would part
with them. Were presents to me, and the photographs have looked
at about one-fourth of the time since imprisonment. One prisoner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
made some buttons here for his little boy at home, and gave them
to me to deliver, as he was about to die. Have them sewed on to
my pants for safe keeping.</p>

<p>July 14.—We have been too busy with the raiders of late to manufacture
any exchange news, and now all hands are at work trying
to see who can tell the biggest yarns. The weak are feeling well
to-night over the story that we are all to be sent North this month,
before the 20th. Have not learned that the news came from any
reliable source. Rumors of midsummer battles with Union troops
victorious. It’s “bite dog, bite bear,” with most of us prisoners;
we don’t care which licks, what we want is to get out of this pen.
Of course, we all care and want our side to win, but it’s tough on
patriotism. A court is now held every day and offenders punished,
principally by buck and gagging, for misdemeanors. The hanging
has done worlds of good, still there is much stealing going on yet,
but in a sly way, not openly. Hold my own as regards health.
The dreaded month of July is half gone, almost, and a good many
over one hundred and fifty die each day, but I do not know how
many. Hardly any one cares enough about it to help me any in
my inquiries. It is all self with the most of them. A guard by
accident shot himself. Have often said they didn’t know enough
to hold a gun. Bury a rebel guard every few days within sight of
the prison. Saw some women in the distance. Quite a sight.
Are feeling quite jolly to-night since the sun went down. Was visited
by my new acquaintances of the 9th Michigan Infantry, who
are comparatively new prisoners. Am learning them the way to
live here. They are very hopeful fellows and declare the war will
be over this coming fall, and tell their reasons very well for thinking
so. We gird up our loins and decide that we will try to live it
through. Rowe, although often given to despondency, is feeling
good and cheerful. There are some noble fellows here. A man
shows exactly what he is in Andersonville. No occasion to be any
different from what you really are. Very often see a great big fellow
in size, in reality a baby in action, actually sniveling and crying,
and then again you will see some little runt, “not bigger than
a pint of cider,” tell the big fellow to “brace up” and be a man.
Stature has nothing to do as regards nerve, still there are noble big
fellows as well as noble little ones. A Sergt. Hill is judge and jury
now, and dispenses justice to evil doers with impartiality. A farce
is made of defending some of the arrested ones. Hill inquires all
of the particulars of each case, and sometimes lets the offenders go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
as more sinned against than sinning. Four receiving punishment.</p>

<p>July 15.—Blank cartridges were this morning fired over the
camp by the artillery, and immediately the greatest commotion outside.
It seems that the signal in case a break is made, is cannon
firing. And this was to show us how quick they could rally and
get into shape. In less time than it takes for me to write it, all
were at their posts and in condition to open up and kill nine-tenths
of all here. Sweltering hot. Dying off one hundred and fifty-five
each day. There are twenty-eight thousand confined here now.</p>

<p>July 16.—Well, who ever supposed that it could be any hotter;
but to-day is more so than yesterday, and yesterday more than the
day before. My coverlid has been rained on so much and burned
in the sun, first one and then the other, that it is getting the worse
for wear. It was originally a very nice one, and home made. Sun
goes right through it now, and reaches down for us. Just like a
bake oven. The rabbit mules that draw in the rations look as if
they didn’t get much more to eat than we do. Driven with one
rope line, and harness patched up with ropes, strings, &amp;c. Fit
representation of the Confederacy. Not much like U. S. Army
teams. A joke on the rebel adjutant has happened. Some one
broke into the shanty and tied the two or three sleeping there, and
carried off all the goods. Tennessee Bill, (a fellow captured with
me) had charge of the affair, and is in disgrace with the adjutant
on account of it. Every one is glad of the robbery. Probably
there was not ten dollars worth of things in there, but they asked
outrageous prices for everything. Adjt. very mad, but no good.
Is a small, sputtering sort of fellow.</p>

<p>July 17.—Cords contracting in my legs and very difficult for me
to walk—after going a little ways have to stop and rest and am
faint. Am urged by some to go to the hospital but don’t like to do
it; mess say had better stay where I am, and Battese says shall not
go, and that settles it. Jimmy Devers anxious to be taken to the
hospital but is pursuaded to give it up. Tom McGill, another
Irish friend, is past all recovery; is in another part of the prison.
Many old prisoners are dropping off now this fearful hot weather;
knew that July and August would thin us out; cannot keep track
of them in my disabled condition. A fellow named Hubbard with
whom I have conversed a good deal, is dead; a few days ago was
in very good health, and its only a question of a few days now with
any of us. Succeeded in getting four small onions about as large
as hickory nuts, tops and all for two dollars Confederate money.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
Battese furnished the money but won’t eat an onion; ask him if
he is afraid it will make his breath smell? It is said that two or
three onions or a sweet potato eaten raw daily will cure the scurvy.
What a shame that such things are denied us, being so plenty the
world over. Never appreciated such things before but shall hereafter.
Am talking as if I expected to get home again. I do.</p>

<p>July 18.—Time slowly dragging itself along. Cut some wretchs
hair most every day. Have a sign out “Hair Cutting,” as well as
“Washing,” and by the way, Battese has a new wash board made
from a piece of the scaffold lumber. About half the time do the
work for nothing, in fact not more than one in three or four pays
anything—expenses not much though, don’t have to pay any rent.
All the mess keeps their hair cut short which is a very good advertisement.
My eyes getting weak with other troubles. Can just
hobble around. Death rate more than ever, reported one hundred
and sixty-five per day; said by some to be more than that, but
165 is about the figure. Bad enough without making any worse
than it really is. Jimmy Devers most dead and begs us to take
him to the hospital and guess will have to. Every morning the
sick are carried to the gate in blankets and on stretchers, and the
worst cases admitted to the hospital. Probably out of five or six
hundred half are admitted. Do not think any lives after being taken
there; are past all human aid. Four out of every five prefer to
stay inside and die with their friends rather than go to the hospital.
Hard stories reach us of the treatment of the sick out there
and I am sorry to say the cruelty emanates from our own men who
act as nurses. These dead beats and bummer nurses are the same
bounty jumpers the U. S. authorities have had so much trouble
with. Do not mean to say that all the nurses are of that class but
a great many of them are.</p>

<p>July 19.—There is no such thing as delicacy here. Nine out of
ten would as soon eat with a corpse for a table as any other way.
In the middle of last night I was awakened by being kicked by a
dying man. He was soon dead. In his struggles he had floundered
clear into our bed. Got up and moved the body off a few feet, and
again went to sleep to dream of the hideous sights. I can never get
used to it as some do. Often wake most scared to death, and
shuddering from head to foot. Almost dread to go to sleep on this
account. I am getting worse and worse, and prison ditto.</p>

<p>July 20.—Am troubled with poor sight together with scurvy and
dropsy. My teeth are all loose and it is with difficulty I can eat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Jimmy Devers was taken out to die to-day. I hear that McGill is
also dead. John McGuire died last night, both were Jackson men
and old acquaintances. Mike Hoare is still policeman and is sorry
for me. Does what he can. And so we have seen the last of
Jimmy. A prisoner of war one year and eighteen days. Struggled
hard to live through it, if ever any one did. Ever since I can
remember have known him. John Maguire also, I have always
known. Everybody in Jackson, Mich., will remember him, as living
on the east side of the river near the wintergreen patch, and his
father before him. They were one of the first families who settled
that country. His people are well to do, with much property.
Leaves a wife and one boy. Tom McGill is also a Jackson boy and
a member of my own company. Thus you will see that three of
my acquaintances died the same day, for Jimmy cannot live until
night I don’t think. Not a person in the world but would have
thought either one of them would kill me a dozen times enduring
hardships. Pretty hard to tell about such things. Small squad of
poor deluded Yanks turned inside with us, captured at Petersburg.
It is said they talk of winning recent battles. Battese has traded
for an old watch and Mike will try to procure vegetables for it from
the guard. That is what will save us if anything.</p>

<p>July 21.—And rebels are still fortifying. Battese has his hands
full. Takes care of me like a father. Hear that Kilpatrick is
making a raid for this place. Troops (rebel) are arriving here by
every train to defend it. Nothing but corn bread issued now and I
cannot eat it any more.</p>

<p>July 22.—A petition is gotten up signed by all the sergeants in
the prison, to be sent to Washington, D. C., <em>begging</em> to be released.
Capt. Wirtz has consented to let three representatives go for that
purpose. Rough that it should be necessary for us to <em>beg</em> to be protected
by our government.</p>

<p>July 23.—Reports of an exchange in August. Can’t stand it till
that time. Will soon go up the spout.</p>

<p>July 24.—Have been trying to get into the hospital, but Battese
won’t let me go. Geo. W. Hutchins, brother of Charlie Hutchins
of Jackson, Mich., died to-day—from our mess. Jimmy Devers is
dead.</p>

<p>July 25.—Rowe getting very bad. Sanders ditto. Am myself
much worse, and cannot walk, and with difficulty stand up. Legs
drawn up like a triangle, mouth in terrible shape, and dropsy worse
than all. A few more days. At my earnest solicitation was carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
to the gate this morning, to be admitted to the hospital. Lay
in the sun for some hours to be examined, and finally my turn came
and I tried to stand up, but was so excited I fainted away. When
I came to myself I lay along with the row of dead on the outside.
Raised up and asked a rebel for a drink of water, and he said:
“Here, you Yank, if you ain’t dead, get inside there!” And with
his help was put inside again. Told a man to go to our mess and
tell them to come to the gate, and pretty soon Battese and Sanders
came and carried me back to our quarters; and here I am, completely
played out. Battese flying around to buy me something
good to eat. Can’t write much more. Exchange rumors.</p>

<p>July 26.—Ain’t dead yet. Actually laugh when I think of the
rebel who thought if I wasn’t dead I had better get inside. Can’t
walk a step now. Shall try for the hospital no more. Had an
onion.</p>

<p>July 27.—Sweltering hot. No worse than yesterday. Said that
two hundred die now each day. Rowe very bad and Sanders getting
so. Swan dead, Gordon dead, Jack Withers dead, Scotty
dead, a large Irishman who has been near us a long time is dead.
These and scores of others died yesterday and day before. Hub
Dakin came to see me and brought an onion. He is just able to
crawl around himself.</p>

<p>July 28.—Taken a step forward toward the trenches since yesterday,
and am worse. Had a wash all over this morning. Battese
took me to the creek; carries me without any trouble.</p>

<p>July 29.—Alive and kicking. Drank some soured water made
from meal and water.</p>

<p>July 30.—Hang on well, and no worse.</p>

TREATMENT.</p>
</div>


<p>Aug. 1.—Just about the same. My Indian friend says: “We all
get away.”</p>

<p>Aug. 2.—Two hundred and twenty die each day. No more news
of exchange.</p>

<p>Aug. 3.—Had some good soup, and feel better. All is done for
me that can be done by my friends. Rowe and Sanders in almost
as bad a condition as myself. Just about where I was two or three
weeks ago. Seem to have come down all at once. August goes
for them.</p>

<p>Aug. 4.—Storm threatened. Will cool the atmosphere. Hard
work to write.</p>

<p>Aug. 5.—Severe storm. Could die in two hours if I wanted to,
but don’t.</p>

<p>Aug. 12.—Warm. Warm. Warm. If I only had some shade
to lay in, and a glass of lemonade.</p>

<p>Aug. 13.—A nice spring of cold water has broken out in camp,
enough to furnish nearly all here with drinking water. God has
not forgotten us. Battese brings it to me to drink.</p>

<p>Aug. 14.—Battese very hopeful, as exchange rumors are afloat.
Talks more about it than ever before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>Aug. 15.—The water is a God-send. Sanders better and Rowe
worse.</p>

<p>Aug. 16.—Still in the land of the living. Capt. Wirtz is sick and
a Lieut. Davis acting in his stead.</p>

<p>Aug. 17.—Hanging on yet. A good many more than two hundred
and twenty-five die now in twenty-four hours. Messes that
have stopped near us are all dead.</p>

<p>Aug. 18.—Exchange rumors.</p>

<p>Aug. 19.—Am still hoping for relief. Water is bracing some up,
myself with others. Does not hurt us.</p>

<p>Aug. 20.—Some say three hundred now die each day. No more
new men coming. Reported that Wirtz is dead.</p>

<p>Aug. 21.—Sleep nearly all the time except when too hot to do so.</p>

<p>Aug. 22—Exchange rumors.</p>

<p>Aug. 23.—Terribly hot.</p>

<p>Aug. 24.—Had some soup. Not particularly worse, but Rowe
is, and Sanders also.</p>

<p>Aug. 25.—In my exuberance of joy must write a few lines.
Received a letter from my brother, George W. Ransom, from Hilton
Head.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Contained only a few words.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> My brother supposed me dead, as I had been so reported; still,
thinking it might not be so, every week or so he would write a letter
and direct to me as a prisoner of war. This letter, very strangely,
reached its destination.</p>

</div>

<p>Aug. 26.—Still am writing. The letter from my brother has
done good and cheered me up. Eye sight very poor and writing
tires me. Battese sticks by; such disinterested friendship is rare.
Prison at its worst.</p>

<p>Aug. 27.—Have now written nearly through three large books,
and still at it. The diary am confident will reach my people if I
don’t. There are many here who are interested and will see that it
goes north.</p>

<p>Aug. 28.—No news and no worse; set up part of the time. Dying
off a third faster than ever before.</p>

<p>Aug. 29.—Exchange rumors afloat. Any kind of a change
would help me.</p>

<p>Aug. 30.—Am in no pain whatever, and no worse.</p>

<p>Aug. 31.—Still waiting for something to turn up. My Indian
friend says: “good news yet.” <span class="smcap">Night.</span>—The camp is full of exchange
rumors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>Sept 1.—Sanders taken outside to butcher cattle. Is sick but
goes all the same. Mike sick and no longer a policeman. Still
rumors of exchange.</p>

<p>Sept. 2.—Just about the same; rumors afloat does me good. Am
the most hopeful chap on record.</p>

<p>Sept. 3.—Trade off my rations for some little luxury and manage
to get up quite a soup. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Sanders sent in to us a quite
large piece of fresh beef and a little salt; another God-send.</p>

<p>Sept. 4.—Anything good to eat lifts me right up, and the beef
soup has done it.</p>

<p>Sept. 4.—The beef critter is a noble animal. Very decided exchange
rumors.</p>

<p>Sept. 5.—The nice spring of cold water still flows and furnishes
drinking water for all; police guard it night and day so to be taken
away only in small quantities. Three hundred said to be dying off
each day.</p>

<p>Sept. 6.—Hurrah! Hurrah!! Hurrah!!! Can’t holler except on
paper. Good news. Seven detachments ordered to be ready to
go at a moment’s notice. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—<em>All who cannot walk must stay
behind.</em> If left behind shall die in twenty-four hours. Battese
says <em>I shall go</em>. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Seven detachments are going out of the
gate; all the sick are left behind. Ours is the tenth detachment
and will go to-morrow so said. The greatest excitement; men
wild with joy. Am worried fearful that I cannot go, but Battese
says I shall.</p>

<p>Sept. 7.—Anxiously waiting the expected summons. Rebels say
as soon as transportation comes, and so a car whistle is music to
our ears. Hope is a good medicine and am sitting up and have
been trying to stand up but can’t do it; legs too crooked and with
every attempt get faint. Men laugh at the idea of my going, as
the rebels are very particular not to let any sick go, still Battese
say I am going. <span class="smcap">Most Dark.</span>—Rebels say we go during the night
when transportation comes. Battese grinned when this news come
and can’t get his face straightened out again.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Marine Hospital</span>, Savannah, Ga., Sept. 15, 1864.—A great
change has taken place since I last wrote in my diary. Am in
heaven now compared with the past. At about midnight, September
7th, our detachment was ordered outside at Andersonville, and
Battese picked me up and carried me to the gate. The men were
being let outside in ranks of four, and counted as they went out.
They were very strict about letting none go but the well ones, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
those who could walk. The rebel adjutant stood upon a box by
the gate, watching very close. Pitch pine knots were burning in
the near vicinity to give light. As it came our turn to go Battese
got me in the middle of the rank, stood me up as well as I could
stand, and with himself on one side and Sergt. Rowe on the other
began pushing our way through the gate. Could not help myself
a particle, and was so faint that I hardly knew what was going on.
As we were going through the gate the adjutant yells out: “Here,
here! hold on there, that man can’t go, hold on there!” and Battese
crowding right along outside. The adjutant struck over the heads
of the men and tried to stop us, but my noble Indian friend kept
straight ahead, hallooing: “He all right, he well, he go!” And so
I got outside, and adjutant having too much to look after to follow
me. After we were outside, I was carried to the railroad in the
same coverlid which I fooled the rebel out of when captured, and
which I presume has saved my life a dozen times. We were crowded
very thick into box cars. I was nearly dead, and hardly knew
where we were or what was going on. We were two days in getting
to Savannah. Arrived early in the morning. The railroads
here run in the middle of very wide, handsome streets. We were
unloaded, I should judge, near the middle of the city. The men
as they were unloaded, fell into line and were marched away.
Battese got me out of the car, and laid me on the pavement. They
then obliged him to go with the rest, leaving me; would not let
him take me. I lay there until noon with four or five others, without
any guard. Three or four times negro servants came to us
from houses near by, and gave us water, milk and food. With
much difficulty I could set up, but was completely helpless. A
little after noon a wagon came and <em>toted</em> us to a temporary hospital
in the outskirts of the city, and near a prison pen they had just
built for the well ones. Where I was taken it was merely an open
piece of ground, having wall tents erected and a line of guards
around it. I was put into a tent and lay on the coverlid. That
night some gruel was given to me, and a nurse whom I had seen in
Andersonville looked in, and my name was taken. The next morning,
September 10th, I woke up and went to move my hands, and
could not do it; could not move either limb so much as an inch.
Could move my head with difficulty. Seemed to be paralyzed, but
in no pain whatever. After a few hours a physician came to my
tent, examined and gave me medicine, also left medicine, and one
of the nurses fed me some soup or gruel. By night I could move<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
my hands. Lay awake considerable through the night thinking.
Was happy as a clam in high tide. Seemed so nice to be under a
nice clean tent, and there was such cool pure air. The surroundings
were so much better that I thought now would be a good time
to die, and I didn’t care one way or the other. Next morning the
doctor came, and with him Sergt. Winn. Sergt. Winn I had had a
little acquaintance with at Andersonville. Doctor said I was terribly
reduced, but he thought I would improve. Told them to wash
me. A nurse came and washed me, and Winn brought me a white
cotton shirt, and an old but clean pair of pants; my old clothing,
which was in rags, was taken away. Two or three times during
the day I had gruel of some kind, I don’t know what. Medicine
was given me by the nurses. By night I could move my feet and
legs a little. The cords in my feet and legs were contracted so, of
course, that I couldn’t straighten myself out. Kept thinking to
myself, “am I really away from that place Andersonville?” It
seemed too good to be true. On the morning of the 12th, ambulances
moved all to the Marine Hospital, or rather an orchard in same
yard with Marine Hospital, where thirty or forty nice new tents
have been put up, with bunks about two feet from the ground,
inside. Was put into a tent. By this time could move my arms
considerable. We were given vinegar weakened with water, and
also salt in it. Had medicine. My legs began to get movable
more each day, also my arms, and to-day I am laying on my stomach
and writing in my diary. Mike Hoare is also in this hospital.
One of my tent mates is a man named Land, who is a printer, same
as myself. I hear that Wm. B. Rowe is here also, but haven’t seen
him.</p>

<p>Sept. 16.—How I do sleep; am tired out, and seems to me I can
just sleep till doomsday.</p>

<p>Sept. 17.—Four in each tent. A nurse raises me up, sitting posture,
and there I stay for hours, dozing and talking away. Whiskey
given us in very small quantities, probably half a teaspoonful
in half a glass of something, I don’t know what. Actually makes
me drunk. I am in no pain whatever.</p>

<p>Sept. 18.—Surgeon examined me very thoroughly to-day. Have
some bad sores caused by laying down so much; put something on
them that makes them ache. Sergt. Winn gave me a pair of socks.</p>

<p>Sept. 19.—A priest gave me some alum for my sore mouth. Had
a piece of sweet potato, but couldn’t eat it. Fearfully weak. Soup
is all I can eat, and don’t always stay down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>Sept. 20.—Too cool for me. The priest said he would come and
see me often. Good man. My left hand got bruised in some way
and rebel done it up. He is afraid gangrene will get in sore.
Mike Hoare is quite sick.</p>

<p>Sept. 21.—Don’t feel as well as I did some days ago. Can’t eat;
still can use my limbs and arms more.</p>

<p>Sept. 22.—Good many sick brought here. Everybody is kind,
rebels and all. Am now differently sick than at any other time.
Take lots of medicine, eat nothing but gruel. Surgeons are very
attentive. Man died in my tent. Oh, if I was away by myself, I
would get well. Don’t want to see a sick man. That makes me
sick.</p>

<p>Sept. 23.—Shall write any way; have to watch nurses and rebels
or will lose my diary. Vinegar reduced I drink and it is good;
crave after acids and salt. Mouth appears to be actually sorer than
ever before, but whether it is worse or not can’t say. Sergt. Winn
says the Doctor says that I must be very careful if I want to get
well. How in the old Harry can I be careful? They are the ones
that had better be careful and give me the right medicine and food.
Gruel made out of a dish cloth to eat.</p>

<p>Sept 24.—Arrowroot soup or whatever you may call it; don’t
like it; makes me sick. Priest spoke to me. Cross and peevish and
they say that is a sure sign will get well. Ain’t sure but shall be a
Catholic yet. Every little while get out the old diary from under
the blanket and write a sentence. Never was made to be sick—too
uneasy. This will do for to-day.</p>

<p>A GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH—GOOD TREATMENT WHICH IS
OPPORTUNE—PARTING WITH RELICS TO BUY LUXURIES—DALY,
THE TEAMSTER AT ANDERSONVILLE, KILLED—A VISIT FROM BATTESE
THE INDIAN, ETC., ETC.</p>
</div>


<p>Sept. 25—Can eat better—or drink rather; some rebel general
dead and buried with honors outside. Had another wash and general
clean up; ocean breezes severe for invalids. Am visited twice
a day by the rebel surgeon who instructs nurses about treatment.
Food principally arrow root; have a little whisky. Sleep great
deal of the time. Land, my acquaintance and mess-mate, is lame
from scurvy, but is not weak and sick as I am. When I think of
anything, say: “Land, put her down,” and he writes what I tell
him. Everything clean here, but then any place is clean after
summering in Andersonville. Don’t improve much and sometimes
not at all; get blue sometimes; nature of the beast suppose; other
sick in the tent worry and make me nervous.</p>

<p>Sept. 26—Am really getting better and hopeful. Battese has the
two first books of my diary; would like to see him. Was mistaken
about Rowe being in the hospital; he is not, but I hear is in the big
stockade with bulk of prisoners. Say we were removed from Andersonville
for the reason that our troops were moving that way.
Well, thank heaven they moved that way. Mike Hoare, the irrepressible
Irishman, is hobbling around and in our tent about half
the time; is also getting well. Quite a number die here not having
the constitution to rally. This is the first hospital I was ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
in. My old coverlid was washed and fumigated the first day in
hospital. Am given very little to eat five or six times a day; washed
with real soap, an improvement on sand. Half a dozen rebel
doctors prowling around, occasionally one that needs dressing
down, but as a general thing are very kind. Can see from my
bunk a large live oak tree which is a curiosity to me. Although it
is hot weather the evenings are cool, in fact cold; ocean breezes.
A discussion on the subject has set me down as weighing about
ninety-five; I think about one hundred and five or ten pounds;
weighed when captured one hundred and seventy-eight; boarding
with the confederacy does not agree with me. The swelling about
my body has all left me. Sergt. Winn belongs to the 100th Ohio;
he has charge of a ward in this hospital.</p>

<p>Sept. 27.—Getting so I can eat a little and like the gruel. Have
prided myself all during the imprisonment on keeping a stiff upper
lip while I saw big strong men crying like children; cruelty and
privations would never make me cry—always so mad, but now it
is different and weaken a little sometimes all to myself. Land, my
sick comrade, writes at my dictation.</p>

<p>Sept 28.—Sent word to Battese by a convalescent who is being
sent to the large prison, that I am getting well. Would like to see
him. Am feeling better. Good many union men in Savannah.
Three hundred sick here, with all kinds of diseases—gangrene,
dropsy, scurvy, typhoid and other fevers, diarrhea, &amp;c. Good care
taken of me. Have medicine often, and gruel. Land does the
writing.</p>

<p>Sept. 29.—Yes, I am better, but poor and weak. Feeling hungry
more now, and can take nourishment quite often. Mike Hoare
calls to see me. He is thinking of escape. Should think a person
might escape from here when able. I shall get well now. Sweet
potatoes for sale. Like to see such things, but cannot eat them.
Rebel officer put his hand on my head a few minutes ago and said
something; don’t know what. It is said the Yankees can throw
shell into Savannah from their gunboats down the river. Sergeant
Winn comes to see me and cheers me up. Winn is a sutler as well
as nurse, that is, he buys eatables from the guards and other rebels,
and sells to our men. Number of marines and sailors in the building
adjoining our hospital; also some Yankee officers sick. Winn
makes quite a little money. They have soap here to wash with.
The encouraging talk of ending the war soon helps me to get well.</p>

<p>Sept. 30.—Am decidedly better and getting quite an appetite but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
can get nothing but broth, gruel, &amp;c. Mouth very bad. Two or
three teeth have come out, and can’t eat any hard food any way.
They give me quinine, at least I think it is quinine. Good many
visitors come here to see the sick, and they look like union people.
Savannah is a fine place from all accounts of it. Mike is getting
entirely over his troubles and talks continually of getting away,
there are a great many Irish about here, and they are principally
union men. Mike wishes I was able to go with him. Nurses are
mostly marines who have been sick and are convalescent. As a
class they are good fellows, but some are rough ones. Are very
profane. The cords in my legs loosening up a little. Whiskey and
water given me to-day, also weakened vinegar and salt. Am all
the time getting better. <span class="smcap">Later</span>—My faithful friend came to see
me to-day. Was awful glad to see him. He is well. A guard
came with him. Battese is quite a curiosity among the Savannah
rebels. Is a very large, broad shouldered Indian, rather ignorant,
but full of common sense and very kind hearted. Is allowed many
favors.</p>

<p>Oct. 1.—A prisoner of war nearly a year. Have stood and went
through the very worst kind of treatment. Am getting ravenously
hungry, but they won’t give me much to eat. Even Mike won’t
give me anything. Says the doctors forbid it. Well, I suppose it
is so. One trouble with the men here who are sick, they are too
indolent and discouraged, which counteracts the effect of medicines.
A dozen or twenty die in the twenty-four hours. Have
probably half tablespoonful of whiskey daily, and it is enough.
Land is a good fellow. (I wrote this last sentence myself, and Land
says he will scratch it out.—Ransom). A high garden wall surrounds
us. Wall is made of stone. Mike dug around the corners
of the walls, and in out-of-the-way places, and got together a mess
of greens out of pusley. Offered me some and then wouldn’t let
me have it. Meaner than pusley. Have threatened to lick the
whole crowd in a week.</p>

<p>Oct. 2.—Coming cool weather and it braces me right up. Sailors
are going away to be exchanged. Ate some sweet potato to-day,
and it beats everything how I am gaining. Drink lots of gruel,
and the more I drink the more I want. Have vinegar and salt and
water mixed together given me, also whiskey, and every little while
I am taking something, either food or medicine, and the more I
take the more I want. Am just crazy for anything, no matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
what. Could eat a mule’s ear. Eat rice and vegetable soup. All
the talk that I hear is to the effect that the war is most over. Don’t
want to be disturbed at all until I am well, which will not be very
long now. All say if I don’t eat too much will soon be well. Mike
lives high. Is an ingenious fellow and contrives to get many good
things to eat. Gives me anything that he thinks won’t hurt me.
Setting up in my bunk. Have washed all over and feel fifty per
cent. better. Just a jumping toward convalescence.</p>

<p>Oct 3.—The hospital is crowded now with sick; about thirty die
now each day. Men who walked away from Andersonville, and
come to get treatment, are too far gone to rally, and die. Heard
Jeff. Davis’ speech read to-day. He spoke of an exchange soon. I
am better where I am for a few weeks yet. Number of sailors
went to-day. Gnaw onion, raw sweet potato. Battese here, will
stay all day and go back to-night. Says he is going with marines
to be exchanged. Give him food, which he is loth to eat although
hungry. Says he will come to see me after I get home to Michigan.</p>

<p>Oct. 4.—Am now living splendid; vegetable diet is driving off
the scurvy and dropsy, in fact the dropsy has dropped out but the
effect remains. Set up now part of the time and talk like a runaway
horse until tired out and then collapse. Heard that all the
prisoners are going to be sent to Millen, Ga. Wrote a few lines
directed to my father in Michigan. Am now given more food but
not much at a time. Two poor fellows in our tent do not get along
as well as I do, although Land is doing well and is going to be a
nurse. The hospital is not guarded very close and Mike Hoare
cannot resist the temptation to escape. Well, joy go with him.
Dosed with quinine and beastly to take. Battese on his last visit
to me left the two first books of my diary which he had in his possession.
There is no doubt but he has saved my life, although he
will take no credit for it. It is said all were moved from Andersonville
to different points; ten thousand went to Florence, ten
thousand to Charleston and ten thousand to Savannah; but the
dead stay there and will for all time to come. What a terrible
place and what a narrow escape I had of it. Seems to me that
fifteen thousand died while I was there; an army almost and as
many men as inhabit a city of fifty thousand population.</p>

<p>Oct. 5.—All in Andersonville will remember Daly, who used to
drive the bread wagon into that place. He came to Savannah with
us and was in this hospital; a few days ago he went away with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
some sailors to be exchanged. Soon after leaving Savannah he fell
off the cars and was killed, and a few hours after leaving here was
brought back and buried; it is said he had been drinking. Getting
better every day, eat right smart. Mike waiting for a favorable
chance to escape and in the meantime is getting well; heard that
Battese has gone away with sailors to our lines. Its wonderful the
noticeable change of air here from that at Andersonville—wonder
that any lived a month inhaling the poison. If some of those good
fellows that died there, Jimmy Devers, Dr. Lewis, Swain, McGuire
and scores of others, had lived through it to go home with me,
should feel better. Have a disagreeable task to perform—that of
going to see the relatives of fifteen or twenty who died and deliver
messages. Rebel surgeons act as if the war was most over, and
not like very bad enemies. Fresh beef issued to those able to eat
it which is not me; can chew nothing hard, in fact cannot chew at
all. Am all tired out and will stop for to-day.</p>

<p>Oct. 7.—Havn’t time to write much; busy eating. Mouth getting
better, cords in my legs loosening up. Battese has not gone;
was here to-day and got a square meal. Don’t much think that I
have heretofore mentioned the fact that I have two small gold rings,
which has been treasured carefully all during my imprisonment.
They were presents to me before leaving home; it is needless to say
they were from lady friends. Have worn them part of the time
and part of the time they have been secreted about my clothes.
Yankee rings are in great demand by the guards; crave delicacies
and vegetables so much that think I may be pardoned for letting
them go now, and as Mike says he can get a bushel of sweet potatoes
for them, have told him to make the trade, and he says will do
it. Sweet potatoes sliced up and put in a dish and cooked with a
piece of beef and seasoned, make a delicious soup. There are
grayback lice in the hospital, just enough for company’s sake—should
feel lonesome without them. Great many visitors come to
look at us and from my bunk can see them come through the gate;
yankees are a curiosity in this southern port, as none were ever
kept here before; I hear that the citizens donate bread and food to
the prisoners.</p>

<p>Oct. 8.—Talk of Millen, about ninety miles from here. Mike
will trade off the rings to-night. Owe Sergt. Winn $12 for onions
and sweet potatoes, confederate money however; a dollar confed.
is only ten cents in money. Hub Dakin, from Dansville, Mich.,
is in this hospital. It is said Savannah will be in our hands in less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
than two months. Some Irish citizens told Mike so. Union army
victorious everywhere. Going on twelve months a prisoner of war.
Don’t want to be exchanged now; could not stand the journey
home; just want to be let alone one month and then home and
friends. Saw myself in a looking glass for the first time in ten
months and am the worst looking specimen—don’t want to go
home in twelve years unless I look different from this; almost inclined
to disown myself. Pitch pine smoke is getting peeled off;
need skinning. Eye sight improving with other troubles. Can’t
begin to read a newspaper and with difficulty write a little at a
time. Can hear big guns every morning from down the river; it is
said to be yankee gunboats bidding the city of Savannah “good
morning.”</p>

<p>Oct. 9.—The reason we have not been exchanged is because if
the exchange is made it will put all the men held by the union
forces right into the rebel army, while the union prisoners of war
held by the rebels are in no condition to do service; that would
seem to me to be a very poor reason. Rowe and Bullock are in
the main prison I hear, and well; it is one of the miracles that
Bullock lived as he was ailing all through Andersonville. Brass
buttons with hens on (eagles) are eagerly sought after by the guards.
Mike still harping on escape, but I attend right to the business of
getting enough to eat. Although can’t eat much have the appetite
all the same. The rebel M. D., by name Pendleton, or some such
name, says if I am not careful will have a relapse, and is rather inclined
to scold; says I get along all together too fast, and tells the
nurse and Mike and Land, that I must not eat but little at a time
and then only such food as he may direct, and if I don’t do as he
says, will put me in the main building away from my friends.
Says it is suicide the way some act after a long imprisonment.
Well, suppose he is right and I must go slow. Names of yankee
officers marked on the tents that have occupied them as prisoner
of war before us.</p>

<p>Oct. 10.—Mike traded off the gold rings for three pecks of sweet
potatoes and half a dozen onions; am in clover. Make nice soup
out of beef, potatoe, bread, onion and salt; can trade a sweet potatoe
for most anything. Mike does the cooking and I do the eating;
he won’t eat my potatoes, some others do though and without
my permission. ’Tis ever thus, wealth brings care and trouble.
Battese came to-day to see me and gave him some sweet potatoes.
He is going away soon the rebels having promised to send him with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
next batch of sailors; is a favorite with rebels. Mike baking bread
to take with him in his flight. Set now at the door of the tent on
a soap box; beautiful shade trees all over the place. Am in the 5th
Ward, tent No. 12; coverlid still does me good service. Many die
here but not from lack of attention or medicine. They haven’t the
vitality to rally after their sufferings at Andersonville. Sisters of
Charity go from tent to tent looking after men of their own religion;
also citizens come among us. Wheat bread we have quite
often and is donated by citizens. Guards walk on the outside of
the wall and only half a dozen or so on the inside, two being at the
gate; not necessary to guard the sick very close. Should judge the
place was some fine private residence before being transformed
into the Marine Hospital. Have good water. What little hair I
have is coming off; probably go home bald-headed.</p>

<p>Oct. 12.—Still getting better fast, and doctor says too fast. Now
do nearly all the diary writing. Hardly seems possible that our
own Yankee gunboats are so near us, so near that we can hear them
fire off their guns, but such is the case. Reports have it that the
Johnny Rebels are about worsted. Has been a hard war and cruel
one. Mike does all my cooking now, although an invalid. He
trades a sweet potato for vinegar, which tastes the best of anything,
also have other things suitable for the sick, and this morning had
an egg. My gold rings will put me in good health again. All the
time medicine, that is, three or four times a day; and sores on my
body are healing up now for the first time. Mouth, which was one
mass of black bloody swellings on the inside, is now white and
inflamation gone, teeth however, loose, and have lost four through
scurvy, having come out themselves. My eyes, which had been
trying to get in out of sight, are now coming out again and look
more respectable. Battese was taken prisoner with eighteen other
Indians; they all died but one beside himself.</p>

<p>Oct. 14.—Did not write any yesterday. A man named Hinton
died in our tent at about two o’clock this morning, and his bunk is
already filled by another sick man. None die through neglect here;
all is done that could reasonably be expected. The pants with those
buttons on to be taken North for a little boy whose father died in
Andersonville, were taken away from me when first taken to the
hospital. Have also lost nearly all the relics, pictures and letters
given me to take North. For a week or ten days could take care
of nothing. Winn took charge of the book that I am writing in
now and Battese had the other two books, and now they are all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
together safe in my charge. Wonder if any one will ever have the
patience or time to read it all? Not less than a thousand pages of
finely written crow tracks, and some places blurred and unintelligable
from being wet and damp. As I set up in my bunk my legs
are just fitted for hanging down over the side, and have not been
straightened for three or four months. Rub the cords with an ointment
furnished me by physician and can see a change for the
better. Legs are blue, red and shiny and in some places the skin
seems calloused to the bone.</p>

<p>Oct. 15.—Richard is getting to be himself again. A very little
satisfies me as regards the upward tendency to health and liberty.
Some would think to look at me almost helpless and a prisoner of
war, that I hadn’t much to feel glad about. Well, let them go
through what I have and then see. Citizens look on me with pity
when I should be congratulated. Am probably the happiest mortal
any where hereabouts. Shall appreciate life, health and enough
to eat hereafter. Am anxious for only one thing, and that is to get
news home to Michigan of my safety. Have no doubt but I am
given up for dead, as I heard I was so reported. Drizzling rain has
set in. Birds chipper from among the trees. Hear bells ring about
the city of Savannah. Very different from the city of Richmond;
there it was all noise and bustle and clatter, every man for himself
and the devil take the hindmost, while here it is quiet and pleasant
and nice. Every one talks and treats you with courtesy and kindness.
Don’t seem as if they could both be cities of the Confederacy.
Savannah has probably seen as little of real war or the
consequence of war, as any city in the South.</p>

<p>Oct. 18.—Every day since last writing I have continued to improve,
and no end to my appetite. Now walk a trifle with the aid
of crutches. Coming cool, and agrees with me, have fresh beef
issued to us. Mike not yet gone. Battese went some days ago
with others to our lines, at least it was supposed to our lines. Hope
to see him sometime. Many have gangrene. Millen still talked
of. See city papers every day, and they have a discouraged tone
as if their cause were on its last legs. Mike goes to-night for sure,
he says. Think if I was in his place would not try to get away, we
are so comfortable here. Still liberty is everything, and none know
what it is except those deprived of it. It’s a duty, we think, to
escape if possible, and it seems possible to get away from here.
Rebel guards that I sometimes come in contact with are marines
who belong to rebel gunboats stationed in the mouth of Savannah<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
River and are on duty here for a change from boat life. They seem
a kindly set, and I don’t believe they would shoot a prisoner if they
saw him trying to get away.</p>

<p>Oct. 19.—Last night I talked with a guard while Mike Hoare
went out of his tunnel and got away safely from the hospital. The
guard was on the inside and I hobbled to where he was and engaged
him in conversation and Mike crawled away. It seems that Mike
learned of some union Irish citizens in the city and his idea is to
reach them which he may do, as there are scarcely any troops about
the city, all being to the front. Now I am alone, best friends all
gone one way or the other. The only acquaintances here now are
Land and Sergt. Winn, with whom I became acquainted in Andersonville.
Not like my other friends though. It is said there are
half a dozen hospitals similar to this in Savannah which are filled
with Andersonville wrecks. They have need to do something to
redeem themselves from past conduct. Don’t believe that it is the
Confederacy that is taking such good care of us, but it is the city
of Savannah; that is about the way it is as near as I can find out.</p>

<p>Oct. 22.—Lieut. Davis commands the prison in Savannah. Is
the same individual who officiated at Andersonville during Wirtz’s
sickness last summer. He is a rough but not a bad man. Probably
does as well as he can. Papers state that they will commence to
move the prisoners soon to Millen, to a Stockade similar to the one
at Andersonville. I am hobbling about the hospital with the help
of two crutches. Have not heard a word from old Mike, or Battese
or any one that ever heard of before, for some days. Sweet potatoes
building me up with the luxuries they are traded for. Had
some rice in my soup. Terrible appetite, but for all that don’t eat
a great deal. Have three sticks propped up at the mouth of our
tent, with a little fire under it, cooking food. Men in tent swear
because smoke goes inside. Make it all straight by giving them
some soup. Rebel surgeons all smoke, at least do while among us.
Have seen prisoners who craved tobacco more than food, and said
of the two would prefer tobacco. I never have used tobacco in
any form.</p>

<p>Oct. 24.—Did not write yesterday. Jumping right along toward
health if not wealth. Discarded crutches and have now two canes.
Get around considerable, a little at a time. It is said that they
want Yankee printers who are prisoners of war to go and work in
the printing offices in the city on parole of honor(?). Will not do
it. Am all right where I am for a month yet, and by that time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
expect to go to our lines. Hub Dakin in hospital now. Priests
still come and go. Convalescent shot and wounded by the guards,
the first I have heard of being hurt since I came to this place. A
small-pox case discovered in hospital and created great excitement.
Was removed. Was loitering near the gate, when an Irish woman
came through it with her arms full of wheat bread. All those able
to rushed up to get some of it and forty hands were pleading for
her favors. After picking her men and giving away half a dozen
loaves her eyes lighted on me and I secured a large loaf. She was
a jolly, good natured woman, and it is said that she keeps a bake
shop. My bad looks stood me in well this time. As beautiful
bread as I ever saw.</p>

<p>Oct. 25.—Am feeling splendid and legs doing nobly, and even
taking on fat. Am to be a gallant nurse as soon as able, so Sergt.
Winn says. Most of the men as soon as convalescent are sent to
big prison, but Winn has spoken a good word for me. Papers say
the prison at Millen, Ga., is about ready for occupancy, and soon
all will be sent there, sick and all. Nights cool and need more
covering than we have. I am congratulated occasionally by prisoners
who saw me in Andersonville. They wonder at my being alive.
Rains.</p>

<p>Oct. 26.—Time passes now fast; most a year since captured.
When the Rebs once get hold of a fellow they hang on for dear life.
Talk that all are to be vaccinated any way, whether they want to or
not. Don’t suppose it will do any harm if good matter is used.
Vaccinate me if they want to. Walk better every day. Sometimes
I overdo a little and feel bad in consequence. Land is “right
smart,” in fact, so smart that he will have to go to the big stockade
pretty soon.</p>

<p>Oct. 27.—A rebel physician (not a regular one), told me that it
looked very dark for the Confederacy just now; that we need have
no fears but we would get home very soon now, which is grand
good news. I have no fears now but all will turn out well. Everything
points to a not far away ending of the war, and all will rejoice,
rebels and all.</p>

<p>Oct. 28.—Am feeling splendid, and legs most straight. Getting
fat fast. Am to be a nurse soon. Reported that they are moving
prisoners to Millen. Over a thousand went yesterday. About ten
thousand of the Andersonville prisoners came to Savannah, ten
thousand went to Florence and ten to Charleston, S. C. Only the
sick were left behind there, and it is said they died like sheep after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
the well ones went away. Great excitement among the Gray-coats.
Some bad army news for them, I reckon. Negroes at work fortifying
about the city.</p>

<p>Oct. 29.—I suppose we must be moved again, from all reports.
Savannah is threatened by Union troops, and we are to be sent to
Millen, Ga. Am sorry, for while I remain a prisoner would like to
stay here, am getting along so nicely and recovering my health. It
is said, however, that Millen is a good place to go to, and we will
have to take the consequences whatever they may be. Can eat
now anything I can get hold of, provided it can be cooked up and
made into the shape of soup. Mouth will not admit of hard food.
This hospital is not far from the Savannah jail, and when the gate
is open we can see it. It is said that some one was hung there not
long ago. Papers referred to it and I asked a guard and he nodded
“Yes.” Have seen one “hanging bee,” and never want to see another
one. Last of my three pecks of sweet potatoes almost gone.
For a dollar, Confed., bought two quarts of guber peas (pea-nuts),
and now I have got them can’t eat them. Sell them for a dollar
per quart—two dollars for the lot. It is thus that the Yankee getteth
wealth. Have loaned one cane to another convalescent and go
around with the aid of one only. Every day a marked improvement.
Ain’t so tall as I “used to was.” Some ladies visited the
hospital to-day to see live Yankees, who crowded around. They
were as much of a curiosity to us as we were to them.</p>

<p>Oct. 30.—It is said prisoners from main prison are being removed
every day, and the sick will go last. Quite a batch of the nearest
well ones were sent from here to-day to go with the others. Am to
be a nurse pretty soon. Don’t think I could nurse a sick cat, still
it’s policy to be one. Winn tells me that he has made money dickering
at trade with the rebels and prisoners. He has trusted me to
twelve dollars worth of things and says he don’t expect or want
pay. The twelve dollars amounts to only one dollar and twenty
cents in our money. The surgeon who has had charge of us has
been sent away to the front. It seems he had been wounded in
battle and was doing home duty until able to again go to his command.
Shall always remember him for his kind and skillful treatment.
Came round and bid us all good bye, and sick sorry to lose
him. Are now in charge of a hospital steward, who does very well.
The atmosphere here makes gentlemen of everybody. Papers say
that the city must be fortified, and it is being done. Considerable
activity about the place. Trains run through at all hours of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
night, evidently shifting their troops to other localities. <span class="smcap">Later</span>—Since
the surgeon went away the rebels are drinking up our whiskey,
and to-night are having a sort of carnival, with some of the
favorite nurses joining in; singing songs, telling stories, and a
good time generally. They are welcome to my share.</p>

<p>Oct. 31.—Reported that the well prisoners have all left this city
for Millen and we go to-night or to-morrow. I am duly installed as
nurse, and walk with only one cane. Legs still slightly drawn up.
Hub Dakin, Land and myself now mess together. Am feeling very
well. Will describe my appearance. Will interest me to read in
after years, if no one else. Am writing this diary to please myself,
now. I weigh one hundred and seventeen pounds, am dressed in
rebel jacket, blue pants with one leg torn off and fringed about
half way between my knee and good sized foot, the same old pair
of miss matched shoes I wore in Andersonville, very good pair of
stockings, a “biled” white shirt, and a hat which is a compromise
between a clown’s and the rebel white partially stiff hat; am poor
as a tad-pole, in fact look just about like an East Tennesseean, of
the poor white trash order. You might say that I am an “honery
looking cuss” and not be far out of the way. My cheeks are sunken,
eyes sunken, sores and blotches both outside and inside my
mouth, and my right leg the whole length of it, red, black and blue
and tender of touch. My eyes, too, are very weak, and in a bright
sun I have to draw the slouch hat away down over them. Bad as
this picture is, I am a beauty and picture of health in comparison
to my appearance two months ago. When taken prisoner was
fleshy, weighing about one hundred and seventy or seventy-five,
round faced, in fact an overgrown, ordinary, green looking chap
of twenty. Had never endured any hardships at all and was a
spring chicken. As has been proven however, I had an iron constitution
that has carried me through and above all a disposition
to make the best of everything no matter how bad, and considerable
will power with the rest. When I think of the thousands and
thousands of thorough-bred soldiers, tough and hearty and capable
of marching thirty, forty, and even fifty miles in twenty-four hours
and think nothing of it, I wonder and keep wondering that it can
be so, that I am alive and gaining rapidly in health and strength.
Believe now that no matter where we are moved to, I shall continue
to improve, and get well. Succumbed only at the last in
Andersonville, when no one could possibly keep well. With this
general inventory of myself and the remark that I haven’t a red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
cent, or even a Confederate shin-plaster, will put up my diary and
get ready to go where ever they see fit to send us, as orders have
come to get ready. <span class="smcap">Later</span>—We are on the Georgia Central Railroad,
en-route for Millen, Ga., which is ninety miles from Savannah,
and I believe north. Are in box cars and very crowded with
sick prisoners. Two nurses, myself being one of them, have charge
of about a hundred sick. There are, however, over six hundred
on the train.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp Lawton</span>, Millen, Ga., Nov. 1.—Arrived at our destination
not far from midnight, and it was a tedious journey. Two died in
the car I was in. Were taken from the cars to this prison in what
they call ambulances, but what I call lumber wagons. Are now
congregated in the south-east corner of the stockade under hastily
put up tents. This morning we have drawn rations, both the sick
and the well, which are good and enough. The stockade is similar
to that at Andersonville, but in a more settled country, the ground
high and grassy, and through the prison runs a stream of good
pure water, with no swamp at all. It is apparently a pleasant and
healthy location. A portion of the prison is timber land, and the
timber has been cut down and lays where it fell, and the men who
arrived before us have been busily at work making shanties and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
places to sleep in. There are about six thousand prisoners here,
and I should judge there was room for twelve or fifteen thousand.
Men say they are given food twice each day, which consists of
meal and fresh beef in rather small quantities, but good and wholesome.
The rebel officer in command is a sociable and kindly
disposed man, and the guards are not strict, that is, not cruelly so.
We are told that our stay here will be short. A number of our
men have been detailed to cook the food for the sick, and their well
being is looked to by the rebel surgeon as well as our own men.
The same surgeon who for the last ten days had charge of us in
Savannah has charge of us now. He does not know over and
above much but on the whole does very well. Barrels of molasses
(nigger toe) have been rolled inside and it is being issued to the
men, about one-fourth of a pint to each man, possibly a little more.
Some of the men, luxuriantly, put their allowances together and
make molasses candy of it. One serious drawback is the scarcity
of dishes, and one man I saw draw his portion in his two hands,
which held it until his comrade could find a receptacle for it.</p>

<p>Nov. 2.—Have seen many of my old comrades of Andersonville,
among whom is my tried friend Sergt. Wm. B. Rowe; were heartily
glad to see one another; also little Bullock who has improved
wonderfully in appearance. Everyone is pleased with this place
and are cheerful, hoping and expecting to be released before many
weeks; they all report as having been well treated in Savannah and
have pleasant recollections of that place; from what could be seen
of the city by us prisoners it seems the handsomest one in America.
Should judge it was a very wealthy place. My duties as nurse are
hard, often too much so for my strength, yet the enforced exercise
does me good and continue to improve all the time. A cane will
be necessary to my locomotion for a long time as am afraid myself
permanently injured; my cane is not a gold headed one; it is a
round picket which has been pulled off some fence. Very cheering
accounts of the war doings. All who want to can take the oath of
allegiance to the confederacy and be released; am happy to say
though that out of all here, but two or three has done so, and they
are men who are a detriment to any army. The weather now is
beautiful, air refreshing, water ditto; all happy and contented and
await coming events with interest. Part of the brook, the lower
part, is planked and sides boarded up for sanitary privileges; water
has also been dammed up and a fall made which carries off the
filth with force. Plenty of wood to do cooking with and the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
putter around with their cooking utensils such as they have. Sort
of prize fight going on now.</p>

<p>Nov. 3.—About a hundred convalescents were taken outside to-day
to be sent away to our lines the officials told us. At a later
hour the commander came inside and said he wanted twelve men
to fall into line and they did so, myself being one of the twelve;
he proceeded to glance us over and on looking at me said: “Step
back out of the ranks, I want only able-bodied men.” I stepped
down and out considerably chagrinned, as the general impression
was that they were to go to our lines with the convalescents who
had been taken outside before. He marched off the twelve men
and it then leaked out that they were to be sent to some prison to
be held as hostages until the end of the war. Then I felt better.
It is said all the sick will be taken outside as soon as they get quarters
fixed up to accommodate them. Think that I shall resign my
position as nurse. Would rather stay with the “boys.” Land is
no longer with the sick but has been turned into the rank and file,
also Dakin. Dakin, Rowe and Land are all together, and if the
sick are taken outside I shall join my old comrades and mess with
them. But few die now; quite a number died from the removal,
but now all seem to be on the mend. I am called, contrary to my
expectations, a good nurse; certainly have pity for the poor unfortunates,
but lack the strength to take care of them. It needs good
strong men to act as nurses.</p>

<p>Nov. 4.—The fine weather still continues. Just warm enough,
and favorable for prisoners. Food now we get but once a day—not
all we want, but three times as much as issued at Andersonville
and of good quality. The officer in command, as I have said
before, is a kind hearted man, and on his appearance inside he was
besieged by hundreds of applications for favors and for the privilege
of going outside on parole of honor. He began granting such
favors as he could, but has been besieged too much and now stays
outside. Has, however, put up a letter box on the inside so that
letters will reach him, and every day it is filled half full. Occasionally
he takes to a letter and sends inside for the writer of it,
and that one answered is the occasion of a fresh batch, until it is
said that the poor man is harrassed about as much as the President
of the United States is for fat offices. As I have before remarked
in my diary, the Yankee is a queer animal.</p>

<p>Nov. 5.—Hostages taken out. Everything is bright and pleasant
and I see no cause to complain, therefore won’t. To-morrow is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
election day at the North; wish I was there to vote—which I ain’t.
Will here say that I am a War Democrat to the backbone. Not
a very stiff one, as my backbone is weak.</p>

<p>Nov. 6.—One year ago to-day captured. Presidential election at
the North between Lincoln and McClellan. Some one fastened up
a box, and all requested to vote, for the fun of the thing. Old prisoners
haven’t life enough to go and vote; new prisoners vote for
present administration. I voted for McClellan with a hurrah, and
another hurrah, and still another. Had this election occurred while
we were at Andersonville, four-fifths would have voted for McClellan.
We think ourselves shamefully treated in being left so long
as prisoners of war. Abe Lincoln is a good man and a good president,
but he is controlled by others who rule the exchange business
as well as most other things. Of course our likes and dislikes make
no difference to him or any one else. Yes, one year ago to-day captured.
A year is a good while, even when pleasantly situated, but
how much longer being imprisoned as we have been. It seems a
lifetime, and I am twenty years older than a year ago. Little
thought that I was to remain all this time in durance vile. Improving
in health, disposition and everything else. If both breeches
legs were of the same length should be supremely happy. Should
make a bon-fire to-night if I wasn’t afraid of celebrating a defeat.
Had lots of fun hurrahing for “Little Mac.”</p>

<p>Nov. 7.—A rather cold rain wets all who have not shelter. Many
ladies come to see us; don’t come through the gate, but look at us
through that loophole. Any one with money can buy extras in the
way of food, but, alas, we have no money. Am now quite a trader—that
is, I make up a very thin dish of soup and sell it for ten
cents, or trade it for something. Am ravenously hungry now and
can’t get enough to eat. The disease has left my system, the body
demands food, and I have to exert my speculative genius to get it,
am quite a hand at such things and well calculated to take care of
myself. A man belonging to the Masonic order need not stay here
an hour. It seems as if every rebel officer was of that craft, and a
prisoner has but to make himself known to be taken care of. Pretty
strong secret association that will stand the fortunes of war.
That is another thing I must do when I get home—join the Masons.
No end of things for me to do: visit all the foreign countries that
prisoners told me about, and not forgetting to take in Boston by
the way, wear silk under clothing, join the masons, and above all
educate myself to keep out of rebel prisons. A person has plenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
of time to think here, more so than in Andersonville; there it was
business to keep alive. Small alligator killed at lower part of the
stream.</p>

<p>Nov. 8.—All eager for news. Seems as if we were on the eve of
something. So quiet here that it must predict a storm. Once in a
while some pesky rebel takes it upon himself to tell us a lot of lies
to the effect that our armies are getting beaten; that England joins
the Confederacy to whip out the North; that there is no prospect
of ending the war; that we are not going to be exchanged at all,
but remain prisoners, etc., etc. If he is a good talker and tells his
story well it makes us all blue and down-hearted. Then, pretty
soon, we are told more joyful news which we are ready to believe,
and again take heart and think of the good times coming. Would
like to hear the election news. Wonder who is elected? Feel
stronger every day, and have a little flesh on my bones. As the
weather gets cool, we are made painfully aware of the fact that we
are sadly deficient in clothing. Will freeze if compelled to stay
through the winter. Coverlid still does duty although disabled by
past experience, same as all of us. We talk over the many good
traits of Battese and others who are separated from us by death and
otherwise. The exploits of Hendryx we will never tire of narrating.
What a meeting when we can get together in future years,
and talk over the days we have lived and suffered together. Exchange
rumors fill the air. One good sign—the rebels are making
no more improvements about this prison; they say we are not to
stay here long. We hear that our troops are marching all through
the South. Guess that is the reason why they think of moving us
all the time. All right, Johnny Rebels, hope we are an elephant
on your hands. Jeff Davis denounced by the papers, which is a
good sign. Occasionally get one in camp, and read it all up. No
library here. Not a scrap of anything to read; principal occupation
looking for stray news.</p>

<p>Nov. 9.—This diary would seem to treat of two things principally,
that of food and exchange. Try to write of something else, but
my thoughts invariably turn to these two subjects. Prisoners of
war will know how to excuse me for thus writing. A dead line
has also been fixed up in Camp Lawton, but thus far no one has
been shot. Rebel doctors inside examining men who may be troubled
with disease prison life might aggravate. Those selected are
taken outside and either put in hospitals or sent to our lines. Yankee
ingenuity is brought into play to magnify diseases, and very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
often a thoroughly well man will make believe that he is going to
die in less than a week unless taken away. Have laughed for an
hour at the way a fellow by the name of Sawyer fooled them. The
<i lang="la">modus operandi</i> will hardly bear writing in these pages, but will do
to tell. Have made a raise of another pair of pants with both legs
of the same length, and I discard the old ones to a “poor” prisoner.
An advantage in the new pair is that there is plenty of room, too,
from being three or four sizes too large, and the legs as long as the
others were short. My one suspender has a partner now, and all
runs smoothly. Although Bullock is fleshing up and getting better
in health, he is a wreck and always will be. Seems to be a complete
change in both body and mind. He was a favorite in our
regiment, well known and well liked. Rowe is the same stiff, stern
patrican as of old, calmly awaiting the next turn in the wheel of
fortune.</p>

<p>Nov. 10.—Pleasant and rather cool. My hair is playing me
pranks. It grows straight up in the air and only on the topmost
part of my head. Where a man is generally bald, it’s right the
other way with me. If there is anything else that can happen to
make me any more ridiculous, now is the time for it to appear.
About all I lack now is to have an eye gouged out. A friend says
that the reason my hair grows the way it does is because I have
been scared so much, and it has stuck up straight so much, that it
naturally has a tendency that way. Perhaps that is it. If I thought
we were to stay here for any length of time would open up a hair
cutting shop; but should hate to get nicely started in business and
a trade worked up, then have an exchange come along and knock
the whole thing in the head. We are not far from the railroad
track, and can listen to the cars going by. Very often Confederate
troops occupy them and they give the old familiar rebel yell. Once
in a while the Yanks get up steam enough to give a good hurrah
back to them. Seems to be a good deal of transferring troops now
in the South. I watch all the movements of the rebels and can
draw conclusions, and am of the opinion that Mr. Confederacy is
about whipped and will soon surrender. It certainly looks that
way to me. Rumors that we are to be moved.</p>

<p>Nov. 11.—Very well fed. There it goes again. Had determined
not to say anything more about how we were fed, and now I have
done it. However, I was not grumbling about it any way. Will
merely add that I have an appetite larger than an elephant. Will
also say that there are rumors of exchange, for a change—a subject<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
that has been spoken of before. Cannot possibly refrain from saying
that I am feeling splendidly and worth a hundred dead men yet.
Have two dollars in Confederate money and if I can sell this half
canteen of dish-water soup shall have another dollar before dark.
“Who takes it? Ah, here ye are! Sold again; business closed for
to-night, gentlemen. Early in the morning shall have a fresh supply
of this delicious soup, with real grease floating on top.” Shutters
put up and we settle down for the night without depositing in
the bank. Shan’t go to sleep until ten or eleven o’clock, but lay
and think, and build those air castles that always fall with a crash
and bury us in the debris. Often hear the baying of hounds from
a distance, through the night—and such strange sounds to the
Northern ear. Good night. In rather a sentimental mood. Wonder
if she is married?</p>

<p>Nov. 12.—Everything quiet and running smoothly. Waiting for
something. Have just heard the election news—Mr. Lincoln again
elected, and “Little Mac” nowhere. Just about as I expected.
Returns were rather slow in coming in, evidently waiting for the
Camp Lawton vote. Well, did what I could for George; hurrahed
until my throat was sore and stayed so for a week; know that I
influenced twenty or thirty votes, and now can get no office because
the political opponent was elected. ’Tis ever thus. Believe I
would make a good postmaster for this place. There is none here
and should have applied immediately, if my candidate had been
elected. More sick taken away on the cars; rebels say to be exchanged.
Appears to be a sort of mystery of late, and can’t make
head nor tail of their movements. Would not be surprised at any
hour to receive news to get ready for our lines. Don’t know that I
have felt so before since my imprisonment. Have lived rather
high to-day on capital made yesterday and early this morning. Just
my way—make a fortune and then spend it.</p>

<p>Nov. 13.—To-day had an incident happen to me; hardly an incident,
but a sort of an adventure. When I was nurse on one or two
occasions I helped the hospital steward make out his report to his
superiors, and in that way got a sort of reputation for knowing
how to do these things a little better than the ordinary run of people,
and rebels in particular. A rebel sergeant came inside at just
about nine o’clock this morning and looked me up and said I was
wanted outside, and so went. Was taken to a house not far from
the stockade, which proved to be the officers head-quarters. There
introduced to three or four officers, whose names do not occur to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
me, and informed that they were in need of some one to do writing
and assist in making out their army papers, and if I would undertake
the job, they would see that I had plenty to eat, and I should
be sent North at the first opportunity. I respectfully, gently and
firmly declined the honor, and after partaking of quite a substantial
meal, which they gave me thinking I would reconsider my
decision, was escorted back inside. Many thought me very foolish
for not taking up with the offer. My reasons for not doing so are
these: I would be clearly working for the Confederacy; can see no
real difference in it from actually entering their army. If I occupied
that position it would relieve some rebel of that duty, and he
could stay in the ranks and fight our men. That is one reason.
Another is the fact that instead of their letting me go to our lines
with the first that went, I would be the very last to go, as they
would need me to do duty for them until the last moment. Was
always willing to do extra duty for our own men, such as issuing
clothing on Belle Isle, also my nursing the sick or in any way doing
for them, but when it comes to working in any way for any rebel,
I shall beg to be excused. Might have gone out and worked in the
printing offices in Savannah had I so wished, as they were short of
men all the time, in fact could hardly issue their papers on account
of the scarcity of printers. And so I am still loyal to the Stars
and Stripes and shall have no fears at looking my friends in the
face when I do go home.</p>

<p>Nov. 14.—The kaleidoscope has taken another turn. Six hundred
taken away this forenoon; don’t know where to. As I was
about the last to come to Millen, my turn will not come for some
days if only six hundred are taken out each day. Rebels say they
go straight to our lines, but their being heavily guarded and every
possible precaution taken to prevent their escape, it does not look
like our lines to me. Probably go to Charleston; that seems to be
the jumping off place. Charleston, for some reason or other, seems
a bad place to go to. Any city familiar with the war I want to
avoid. Shall hang back as long as I can, content to let well enough
alone. Some of my friends, of which Bullock is one, flanked out
with those going off. What I mean by “flanked out” is crowding
in when it is not their turn and going with the crowd. Hendryx
and I did that when we left Belle Isle, and we brought up in Andersonville.
Will let those do the flanking who want to, I don’t.</p>

<p>Nov. 15.—At about six or seven o’clock last night six hundred
men were taken away, making in all twelve hundred for the day;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
another six hundred are ready to go at a moment’s notice. I don’t
know what to think. Can hardly believe they go to our lines.
Seems almost like a funeral procession to me, as they go through
the gate. Rowe and Hub Dakin talk of going to-day, if any go, having
decided to flank. I have concluded to wait until it is my turn
to go. If it is an exchange there is no danger but all will go, and
if not an exchange would rather be here than any place I know of
now. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Eight hundred have gone, with Rowe and Dakin
in the crowd, and I am here alone as regards personal friends.
Could not be induced to go with them. Have a sort of presentiment
that all is not right. <span class="smcap">Still Later.</span>—Six hundred more have
gone, making 2,600 all together that have departed, all heavily
guarded.</p>

<p>Nov. 16.—A decided thinness in our ranks this morning. Still
house keeping goes right along as usual. Rebels not knowing how
to figure give us just about the same for the whole prison as when
all were here. Had a talk with a rebel sergeant for about an hour.
Tried to find out our destination and could get no satisfaction,
although he said we were going to our lines. Told him I was a
mason, odd-fellow, had every kind of religion (in hopes to strike
his), and flattered him until I was ashamed of myself. In a desultory
sort of way he said he “reckoned we war goin’ nawth.” Well,
I will write down the solution I have at last come to, and we will
see how near right I am after a little. Our troops, Sherman or
Kilpatrick or some of them, are raiding through the South, and we
are not safe in Millen, as we were not safe in Andersonville, and as
was plainly evident we were not safe in Savannah. There is the
whole thing in a nutshell, and we will see. Six hundred gone to-day.</p>

<p>Nov. 17.—It is now said that the prisoners are being moved down
on the coast near Florida. That coincides with my own view, and
I think it very probable. Will try and go about to-morrow. Hardly
think I can go to-day. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—The to-day’s batch are going
out of the gate. Makes me fairly crazy to wait, fearful I am missing
it in not going. This lottery way of living is painful on the
nerves. There are all kinds of rumors. Even have the story afloat
that now the raid is over that drove us away from Andersonville,
we are going back there to stay during the war. That would be a
joke. However, I stick to my resolution that the rebels don’t really
know themselves where we are going. They move us because we
are not safe here. They are bewildered. Believing this am in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
comparatively easy state of mind. Still I worry. Haven’t said
a word in a week about my health. Well, I am convalescing all the
time. Still lame, and always expect to be; can walk very well
though, and feeling lively for an old man.</p>

<p>Nov. 18.—None being taken away to-day, I believe on account
of not getting transportation. Notice that rebel troops are passing
through on the railroad and immense activity among them. Am
now well satisfied of the correctness of my views as regards this
movement. Have decided now to stay here until the last. Am
getting ready for action however. Believe we are going to have a
warm time of it in the next few months. Thank fortune I am as
well as I am. Can stand considerable now. Food given us in
smaller quantities, and hurriedly so too. All appears to be in a
hurry. Cloudy, and rather wet weather, and getting decidedly
cooler. My noble old coverlid is kept rolled up and ready to
accompany me on my travels at any moment. Have my lame and
stiff leg in training. Walk all over the prison until tired out so as
to strengthen myself. Recruiting officers among us trying to induce
prisoners to enter their army. Say it is no exchange for during the
war, and half a dozen desert and go with them. Even if we are
not exchanged during the war, don’t think we will remain prisoners
long.</p>

<p>Nov. 19.—A car load went at about noon, and are pretty well
thinned out. Over half gone—no one believes to our lines now;
all hands afraid of going to Charleston. Believe I shall try and
escape on the journey, although in no condition to rough it. Am
going to engineer this thing to suit myself and have a little fun.
Would like to be out from under rebel guard once more. When
I can look around and not see a prison wall and a gun ready to
shoot me, I shall rejoice. Have edged up to another comrade and
we bunk together. Said comrade is Corporal Smith, belonging to
an Indiana regiment. While he is no great guns, seems quite a
sensible chap and a decided improvement on many here to mess
with. The nights are cool, and a covering of great benefit. My
being the owner of a good blanket makes me a very desirable comrade
to mess with. Two or three together can keep much warmer
than one alone. It is said that a number of outsiders have escaped
and taken to the woods. Another load goes to-night or early in the
morning. My turn will come pretty soon. Nothing new in our
situation or the prospects ahead. Food scarce, but of good quality.
More go and I go to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Nov. 20.—None as yet gone to-day and it is already most night.
My turn would not come until to-morrow, and if none go at all to-day
I will probably not get away until about day after to-morrow.
Shan’t flank out, but await my turn and go where fate decrees.
Had a falling out with my companion Smith, and am again alone
walking about the prison with my coverlid on my shoulders. Am
determined that this covering protects none but thoroughly good
and square fellows. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Going to be a decidedly cold night,
and have “made up” with two fellows to sleep together. The
going away is the all absorbing topic of conversation. Received
for rations this day a very good allowance of hard-tack and bacon.
This is the first hard-tack received since the trip to Andersonville,
and is quite a luxury. It is so hard that I have to tack around and
soak mine up before I am able to eat it. There is a joke to this.
Will again go to bed as I have done the last week, thinking every
night would be the last at Camp Lawton.</p>

<p>Nov. 21.—Got up bright and early, went to the creek and had a
good wash, came back, after a good walk over the prison, and ate
my two large crackers and small piece of bacon left over from yesterday,
and again ready for whatever may turn up. Lost my
diminutive cake of soap in the water and must again take to sand
to scrub with, until fortune again favors me. Men are very restless
and reckless, uncertainty making them so. Try my very best
not to have any words or trouble with them, but occasionally get
drawn into it, as I did this morning. Came out solid however. Is
pretty well understood that I can take care of myself. <span class="smcap">Noon.</span>—Five
hundred getting ready to go; my turn comes to-morrow, and
then we will see what we will see. Decided rumors that Sherman
has taken Atlanta and is marching toward Savannah, the heart of
the Confederacy. All in good spirits for the first time in a week.</p>

</div>


<p>Nov. 22.—And now my turn has come, and I get off with the
next load going to-day. My trunk is packed and baggage duly
checked; shall try and get a “lay over” ticket, and rusticate on the
road. Will see the conductor about it. A nice cool day with sun
shining brightly—a fit one for an adventure and I am just the boy
to have one. Coverlid folded up and thrown across my shoulder,
lower end tied as only a soldier knows how. My three large books
of written matter on the inside of my thick rebel jacket, and fastened
in. Have a small book which I keep at hand to write in now.
My old hat has been exchanged for a red zouave cap, and I look
like a red headed woodpecker. Leg behaving beautifully. My
latest comrades are James Ready and Bill Somebody. We have
decided to go and keep together on the cars. One of them has an
apology for a blanket, and the two acting in conjunction keep all
three warm nights. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—On the cars, in vicinity of Savannah
en-route for Blackshear, which is pretty well south and not far
from the Florida line. Are very crowded in a close box car and
fearfully warm. Try to get away to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Woods near Doctortown Station, No. 5</span>, Ga., Nov.
23.—A change has come over the spirit of my dreams. During the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
night the cars ran very slow, and sometimes stopped for hours on
side tracks. A very long, tedious night, and all suffered a great
deal with just about standing room only. Impossible to get any
sleep. Two guards at each side door, which were open about a
foot. Guards were passably decent, although strict. Managed to
get near the door, and during the night talked considerable with the
two guards on the south side of the car. At about three o’clock
this <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, and after going over a long bridge which spanned the
Altamaha River and in sight of Doctortown, I went through the
open door like a flash and rolled down a high embankment. Almost
broke my neck, but not quite. Guard fired a shot at me, but
as the cars were going, though not very fast, did not hit me.
Expected the cars to stop but they did not, and I had the inexpressible
joy of seeing them move off out of sight. Then crossed the
railroad track going north, went through a large open field and
gained the woods, and am now sitting on the ground leaning up
against a big pine tree <em>and out from under rebel guard</em>! The sun is
beginning to show itself in the east and it promises to be a fine day.
Hardly know what to do with myself. If those on the train notified
Doctortown people of my escape they will be after me. Think
it was at so early an hour that they might have gone right through
without telling any one of the jump off. Am happy and hungry
and considerably bruised and scratched up from the escape. The
happiness of being here, however, overbalances everything else. If
I had George Hendryx with me now would have a jolly time, and
mean to have as it is. Sun is now up and it is warmer; birds
chippering around, and chipmunks looking at me with curiosity.
Can hear hallooing off a mile or so, which sounds like farmers calling
cattle or hogs or something. All nature smiles—why should
not I?—and I do. Keep my eyes peeled, however, and look all
ways for Sunday. Must work farther back toward what I take to
be a swamp a mile or so away. Am in a rather low country
although apparently a pretty thickly settled one; most too thickly
populated for me, judging from the signs of the times. It’s now
about dinner time, and I have traveled two or three miles from the
railroad track, should judge and am in the edge of a swampy forest,
although the piece of ground on which I have made my bed is
dry and nice. Something to eat wouldn’t be a bad thing. Not
over sixty rods from where I lay is a path evidently travelled more
or less by negroes going from one plantation to another. My hope
of food lays by that road. Am watching for passers by. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
negro boy too young to trust has gone by singing and whistling,
and carrying a bundle and a tin pail evidently filled with somebody’s
dinner. In as much as I want to enjoy this out-door Gypsy
life, I will not catch and take the dinner away from him. That
would be the height of foolishness. Will lay for the next one
traveling this way. The next one is a dog and he comes up and
looks at me, gives a bark and scuds off. Can’t eat a dog. Don’t
know how it will be to-morrow though. Might be well enough for
him to come around later. Well, it is most dark and will get ready
to try and sleep. Have broken off spruce boughs and made a soft
bed. Have heard my father tell of sleeping on a bed of spruce, and
it is healthy. Will try it. Not a crust to eat since yesterday forenoon.
Am educated to this way of living though, and have been
hungryer. Hope the pesky alligators will let me alone. If they
only knew it, I would make a poor meal for them. Thus closes my
first day of freedom and it is <em>grand</em>. Only hope they may be many,
although I can hardly hope to escape to our lines, not being in a
condition to travel.</p>

<p>Nov. 24.—Another beautiful morning, a repetition of yesterday,
opens up to me. It is particularly necessary that I procure sustenance
wherewith life is prolonged, and will change my head-quarters
to a little nearer civilization. Can hear some one chopping not
a mile away. Here goes. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Found an old negro fixing up
a dilapidated post and rail fence. Approached him and enquired
the time of day. (My own watch having run down.) He didn’t happen
to have his gold watch with him, but reckoned it was nigh
time for the horn. Seemed scared at the apparition that appeared
to him, and no wonder. Forgave him on the spot. Thought it
policy to tell him all about who and what I was, and did so. Was
very timid and afraid, but finally said he would divide his dinner
as soon as it should be sent to him, and for an hour I lay off a distance
of twenty rods or so, waiting for that dinner. It finally came,
brought by the same boy I saw go along yesterday. Boy sat down
the pail and the old darkey told him to scamper off home—which
he did. Then we had dinner of rice, cold yams and fried bacon.
It was a glorious repast, and I succeeded in getting quite well
acquainted with him. We are on the Bowden plantation and he
belongs to a family of that name. Is very fearful of helping me
as his master is a strong Secesh., and he says would whip him
within an inch of his life if it was known. Promise him not to be
seen by any one and he has promised to get me something more to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
eat after it gets dark. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—After my noonday meal went back
toward the low ground and waited for my supper, which came
half an hour ago and it is not yet dark. Had a good supper of
boiled seasoned turnips, corn bread and sour milk, the first milk I
have had in about a year. Begs me to go off in the morning, which
I have promised to do. Says for me to go two or three miles on to
another plantation owned by LeCleye, where there are good negroes
who will feed me. Thanked the old fellow for his kindness. Says
the war is about over and the Yanks expected to free them all soon.
It’s getting pretty dark now, and I go to bed filled to overflowing;
in fact, most too much so.</p>

<p>Nov. 25.—This morning got up cold and stiff; not enough covering.
Pushed off in the direction pointed out by the darkey of yesterday.
Have come in the vicinity of negro shanties and laying in
wait for some good benevolent colored brother. Most too many
dogs yelping around to suit a runaway Yankee. Little nigs and
the canines run together. If I can only attract their attention without
scaring them to death, shall be all right. However, there is
plenty of time, and won’t rush things. Time is not valuable with
me. Will go sure and careful. Don’t appear to be any men folks
around; more or less women of all shades of color. This is evidently
a large plantation; has thirty or forty negro huts in three or
four rows. They are all neat and clean to outward appearances.
In the far distance and toward what I take to be the main road is
the master’s residence. Can just see a part of it. Has a cupola on
top and is an ancient structure. Evidently a nice plantation. Lots
of cactus grows wild all over, and is bad to tramp through. There
is also worlds of palm leaves, such as five cent fans are made of.
Hold on there, two or three negro men are coming from the direction
of the big house to the huts. Don’t look very inviting to
trust your welfare with. Will still wait, McCawber like, for something
to turn up. If they only knew the designs I have on them,
they would turn pale. Shall be ravenous by night and go for them.
I am near a spring of water, and lay down flat and drink. The
“Astor House Mess” is moving around for a change; hope I won’t
make a mess of it. Lot of goats looking at me now, wondering, I
suppose, what it is. Wonder if they butt? Shoo! Going to rain,
and if so I must sleep in one of those shanties. Negroes all washing
up and getting ready to eat, with doors open. No, thank you;
dined yesterday. Am reminded of the song: “What shall we do,
when the war breaks the country up, and scatters us poor darkys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
all around.” This getting away business is about the best investment
I ever made. Just the friendliest fellow ever was. More than
like a colored man, and will stick closer than a brother if they will
only let me. Laugh when I think of the old darky of yesterday’s
experience, who liked me first rate only wanted me to go away.
Have an eye on an isolated hut that looks friendly. Shall approach
it at dark. People at the hut are a woman and two or three children,
and a jolly looking and acting negro man. Being obliged to
lay low in the shade feel the cold, as it is rather damp and moist.
<span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Am in the hut and have eaten a good supper. Shall sleep
here to-night. The negro man goes early in the morning, together
with all the male darky population, to work on fortifications at
Fort McAllister. Says the whole country is wild at the news of
approaching Yankee army. Negro man named “Sam” and woman
“Sady.” Two or three negroes living here in these huts are not
trustworthy, and I must keep very quiet and not be seen. Children
perfectly awe struck at the sight of a Yankee. Negroes very
kind but afraid. Criminal to assist me. Am five miles from Doctortown.
Plenty of “gubers” and yams. Tell them all about my
imprisonment. Regard the Yankees as their friends. Half a dozen
neighbors come in by invitation, shake hands with me, scrape
the floor with their feet, and rejoice most to death at the good times
coming. “Bress de Lord,” has been repeated hundreds of times in
the two or three hours I have been here. Surely I have fallen
among friends. All the visitors donate of their eatables, and
although enough is before me to feed a dozen men, I give it a tussle.
Thus ends the second day of my freedom, and it is glorious.</p>

<p>Nov. 26.—An hour before daylight “Sam” awoke me and said I
must go with him off a ways to stay through the day. Got up, and
we started. Came about a mile to a safe hiding place, and here I
am. Have plenty to eat and near good water. Sam will tell
another trusty negro of my whereabouts, who will look after me,
as he has to go away to work. The negroes are very kind, and I
evidently am in good hands. Many of those who will not fight in
the Confederate army are hid in these woods and swamps, and
there are many small squads looking them up with dogs and guns
to force them into the rebel ranks. All able-bodied men are conscripted
into the army in the South. It is possible I may be captured
by some of these hunting parties. It is again most night and
have eaten the last of my food. Can hear the baying of hounds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
and am skeery. Shall take in all the food that comes this way in
the meantime. Sam gave me an old jack knife and I shall make a
good bed to sleep on, and I also have an additional part of a blanket
to keep me warm. In fine spirits and have hopes for the future.
Expect an ambassador from my colored friends a little later.
<span class="smcap">Later.</span>—The ambassador has come and gone in the shape of a woman.
Brought food; a man told her to tell me to go off a distance
of two miles or so, to the locality pointed out, before daylight, and
wait there until called upon to-morrow. Rebel guards occupy the
main roads, and very unsafe.</p>

<p>Nov. 27.—Before daylight came where I now am. Saw alligators—small
ones. This out in the woods life is doing me good.
Main road three miles away, but there are paths running everywhere.
Saw a white man an hour ago. Think he was a skulker
hiding to keep out of the army, but afraid to hail him. Many of
these stay in the woods day-times, and at night go to their homes,
getting food. Am now away quite a distance from any habitation,
and am afraid those who will look for me cannot find me. Occasionally
hear shots fired; this is a dangerous locality. Have now
been out four days and fared splendidly. Have hurt one of my
ankles getting through the brush; sort of sprain, and difficult to
travel at all. No water near by and must move as soon as possible.
Wild hogs roam around through the woods, and can run like a
deer. Palm leaves grow in great abundance, and are handsome to
look at. Some of them very large. Occasionally see lizards and
other reptiles, and am afraid of them. If I was a good traveler I
could get along through the country and possibly to our lines.
Must wander around and do the best I can however. Am armed
with my good stout cane and the knife given me by the negro; have
also some matches, but dare not make a fire lest it attract attention.
Nights have to get up occasionally and stamp around to get warm.
Clear, cool nights and pleasant. Most too light, however, for me
to travel. The remnants of yesterday’s food, have just eaten. Will
now go off in an easterly direction in hopes of seeing the messenger.</p>

<p>Nov. 28.—No one has come to me since day before yesterday.
Watched and moved until most night of yesterday but could see or
hear no one. Afraid I have lost communication. In the distance
can see a habitation and will mog along that way. Most noon.
<span class="smcap">Later.</span>—As I was poking along through some light timber, almost
ran into four Confederates with guns. Lay down close to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
ground and they passed by me not more than twenty rods away.
Think they have heard of my being in the vicinity and looking me
up. This probably accounts for not receiving any visitor from the
negroes. Getting very hungry, and no water fit to drink. Must
get out of this community as fast as I can. Wish to gracious I
had two good legs. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—It is now nearly dark and I have
worked my way as near direct north as I know how. Am at least
four miles from where I lay last night. Have seen negroes, and
white men, but did not approach them. Am completely tired out
and hungry, but on the edge of a nice little stream of water. The
closing of the fifth day of my escape. Must speak to somebody to-morrow,
or starve to death. Good deal of yelling in the woods.
Am now in the rear of a hovel which is evidently a negro hut, but
off quite a ways from it. Cleared ground all around the house so
I can’t approach it without being too much in sight. Small negro
boy playing around the house. Too dark to write more.</p>

<p>Nov. 29.—The sixth day of freedom, and a hungry one. Still
where I wrote last night, and watching the house. A woman goes
out and in but cannot tell much about her from this distance. No
men folks around. Two or three negro boys playing about. Must
approach the house, but hate to. <span class="smcap">Noon.</span>—Still right here. Hold
my position. More than hungry. Three days since I have eaten
anything, with the exception of a small potatoe and piece of bread
eaten two days ago and left from the day before. That length of
time would have been nothing in Andersonville, but now being in
better health demand eatables, and it takes right hold of this wandering
sinner. Shall go to the house towards night. A solitary
woman lives there with some children. My ankle from the sprain
and yesterday’s walking is swollen and painful. Bathe it in water,
which does it good. Chickens running around. Have serious meditations
of getting hold of one or two of them after they go to
roost, then go farther back into the wilderness, build a fire with
my matches and cook them. That would be a royal feast. But if
caught at it, it would go harder with me than if caught legitimately.
Presume this is the habitation of some of the skulkers who
return and stay home nights. Believe that chickens squawk when
being taken from the roost. Will give that up and walk boldly up
to the house.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Doctortown Station, No. 5</span>, Nov. 30.—Ha! Ha! My boy, you
are a prisoner of war again. Once more with a blasted rebel standing
guard over me, and it all happened in this wise: Just before
dark I went up to that house I spoke of in my writings yesterday.
Walked boldly up and rapped at the door; and what was my complete
astonishment when a white woman answered my rapping.
Asked me what I wanted, and I told her something to eat. Told
me to come in and set down. She was a dark looking woman and
could easily be mistaken from my hiding place of the day for a
negro. Began asking me questions. Told her I was a rebel soldier,
had been in the hospital sick and was trying to reach home in
the adjoining county. Was very talkative; told how her husband
had been killed at Atlanta, &amp;c. She would go out and in from a
shanty kitchen in her preparation of my supper. I looked out
through a window and saw a little darky riding away from the
house, a few minutes after I went inside. Thought I had walked
into a trap, and was very uneasy. Still the woman talked and
worked, and I talked, telling as smoothe lies as I knew how. For
a full hour and a half sat there, and she all the time getting supper.
Made up my mind that I was the same as captured, and so put on
a bold face and made the best of it. Was very well satisfied with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
my escapade anyway, if I could only get a whack at that supper
before the circus commenced. Well, after a while heard some
hounds coming through the woods and towards the house. Looked
at the woman and her face pleaded guilty, just as if she had done
something very mean. The back door of the house was open and
pretty soon half a dozen large blood hounds bounded into the room
and began snuffing me over; about this time the woman began to
cry. Told her I understood the whole thing and she need not make
a scene over it. Said she knew I was a yankee and had sent for
some men at Doctortown. Then five horsemen surrounded the
house, dismounted and four of them came in with guns cocked
prepared for a desperate encounter. I said: “good evening, gentlemen.”
“Good evening,” said the foremost, “we are looking for
a runaway yankee prowling around here.” “Well,” says I, “you
needn’t look any farther, you have found him.” “Yes, I see,”
was the answer. They all sat down, and just then the woman said
“supper is ready and to draw nigh.” Drawed as nigh as I could
to that supper and proceeded to take vengeance on the woman.
The fellows proved to be home guards stationed here at Doctortown.
The woman had mounted the negro boy on a horse just as soon as
I made my appearance at the house and sent for them. They
proved to be good fellows. Talked there at the house a full hour
on the fortunes of war, &amp;c. Told them of my long imprisonment
and escape and all about myself. After a while we got ready to
start for this place. One rebel rode in front, one on each side and
two in the rear of me. Was informed that if I tried to run they
would shoot me. Told them no danger of my running, as I could
hardly walk. They soon saw that such was the case after going a
little way, and sent back one of the men to borrow the woman’s
horse. Was put on the animal’s back and we reached Doctortown
not far from midnight. As we were leaving the house the woman
gave me a bundle; said in it was a shirt and stockings. Told her
she had injured me enough and I would take them. No false delicy
will prevent my taking a shirt. And so my adventure has ended
and have enjoyed it hugely. Had plenty to eat with the exception
of the two days, and at the last had a horseback ride. How well I
was reminded of my last ride when first taken prisoner and at the
time I got the coverlid. In the bundle was a good white shirt, pair
of stockings, and a chunk of dried beef of two pounds or so.
One of the captors gave me ten dollars in Confederate money.
Now am in an old vacant building and guarded and it is the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
of the afternoon. Many citizens have visited me and I tell the
guard he ought to charge admission; money in it. Some of the
callers bring food and are allowed to give it to me, and am stocked
with more than can conveniently carry. Have had a good wash
up, put on my clean white shirt with standing collar, and new
stockings and am happy. Doctortown is a small village with probably
six or eight hundred population, and nigger young ones by
the scores. Am treated kindly and well, and judge from conversations
that I hear, that the battles are very disastrous to the rebels
and that the war is pretty well over. All the negroes are hard
pressed, fortifying every available point to contest the advance of
the Union Army. This is cheering news to me. My escape has
given me confidence in myself, and I shall try it again the first
opportunity. A woman has just given me a bottle of milk and
two dollars in money. Thanked her with my heart in my mouth.
Having been captured and brought to this place, am here waiting
for them to get instructions as to what they shall do with me.
They say I will probably be sent to the prison at Blackshear, which
is forty or fifty miles away. Think I should be content to stay
here with plenty to eat. Am in a good clean room in a dwelling.
Can talk with any one who chooses to come and see me. The
room was locked during the night, and this morning was thrown
open, and I can wander through three rooms. Guard is off a few
rods where he can see all around the house. Occasionally I go out
doors and am having a good time. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Have seen a Savannah
paper which says Sherman and his hosts are marching toward that
city, and for the citizens to rally to repel the invader. My swollen
ankle is being rubbed to-day with ointment furnished by an old
darky. I tell you there are humane people the world over, who will
not see even an enemy suffer if they can help it. While I have seen
some of the worst people in the South, I have also seen some of
the very best, and those, too, who were purely southern people and
rebels. There are many pleasant associations connected with my
prison life, as well as some directly to the opposite.</p>

<p>Dec. 1.—Still at Doctortown, and the town is doctoring me up
“right smart.” There is also a joke to this, but a weak one. The
whole town are exercised over the coming of the Yankee army,
and I laugh in my sleeve. Once in a while some poor ignorant and
bigoted fellow amuses himself cursing me and the whole U. S.
army. Don’t talk back much, having too much regard for my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
bodily comfort. Orders have come to put me on a train for Blackshear.
Have made quite a number of friends here, who slyly talk
to me encouragingly. There are many Union people all through
the South, although they have not dared to express themselves as
such, but now they are more decided in their expressions and
actions. Had a canteen of milk, and many other luxuries. Darkys
are profuse in their gifts of small things. Have now a comb, good
jack knife, and many little nicknacks. One old negress brought
me a chicken nicely roasted. Think of that, prisoners of war, roast
chicken! Shall jump off the cars every twenty rods hereafter.
Tried to get a paper of the guard, who was reading the latest, but
he wouldn’t let me see it. Looks rather blue himself, and I surmise
there is something in it which he don’t like. All right, old
fellow, my turn will come some day. Young darky brought me
a cane, which is an improvement on my old one. Walk now the
length of my limit with an old fashioned crook cane and feel quite
proud. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Got all ready to take a train due at 3:30, and it
didn’t stop. Must wait until morning. Hope they won’t stop for
a month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackshear, Ga.</span>, Dec. 2.—In with the same men whom I deserted
on the cars. We are near the Florida line. Was put in a
passenger train at Doctortown and rode in style to this place. On
the train were two more Yanks named David and Eli S. Buck, who
are Michigan men. They were runaways who had been out in the
woods nearly three months and were in sight of our gunboats when
recaptured. Belong to the 6th Michigan Cavalry. David Buck
was one of Kilpatrick’s scouts; a very smart and brave fellow,
understands living in the woods, and thoroughly posted. We have
mutually agreed to get away the first chance, and shall get to our
lines. David Buck used to attend school at Leoni, Mich., and was
educated for a preacher. They are cousins. We three Yankees
were quite a curiosity to the passengers on the train that brought
us to this place. Some of them had evidently never seen a Yankee
before, and we were stared at for all we were worth. Some smarties
were anxious to argue the point with us in a rather “we have
got you” style. David Buck is a good talker, and satisfactorily
held up our end of the war question; in fact, I thought talked them
all out on their own grounds. The ladies in particular sneered and
stared at us. Occasionally we saw some faces which looked as if
they were Union, and we often got a kind word from some of them.
The railroads are in a broken down condition, out of decent repair,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
and trains run very slow. The Confederacy is most assuredly hard
up, and will go to pieces some of these days. My out-door life of
the few days I roamed through the woods, was just jolly. Being
out from under rebel guard made me the happiest chap imaginable.
Knew that I couldn’t escape to our lines, as I was not able to travel
much, and my sole business was to remain a tramp as long as
possible, and to get enough to eat, which I did. The negroes, and
especially the field hands, are all Union darkys, and fed me all I
wanted as a general thing. Made a mistake in going to the house
of a white woman for food.</p>

<p>Dec. 3.—Blackshear is an out-of-the-way place, and shouldn’t
think the Yankee army would ever find us here. The climate is
delightful. Here it is December and at the North right in the
middle of winter, and probably good sleighing, and cold; while
here it is actually warm during the day time, and at night not
uncomfortably cold. The Buck boys are jolly good fellows, and
full of fun. Seem to have taken a new lease of life myself. Both
of them are in good health and fleshy, and open for an escape any
hour. And we don’t stay here but a few days, the guards say.
Why not keep us on the cars and run us around the country all the
time? There is no wall or anything around us here, only guards.
Encamped right in the open air. Have food once a day, just whatever
they have to give us. Last night had sweet potatoes. I am
getting considerably heavier in weight, and must weigh one hundred
and forty pounds or more. Still lame, however, and I fear
permanently so. Teeth are firm in my mouth now, and can eat as
well as ever, and oh! such an appetite. Would like to see the pile
of food that I couldn’t eat. Found Rowe and Bullock, and Hub
Dakin. They are well, and all live in jolly expectancy of the next
move. The old coverlid still protects my person. The Bucks have
also each a good blanket, and we are comfortable. Some fresh
beef given us to-day; not much, but suppose all they have got.
Guard said he wished to God he was one of us prisoners instead of
guarding us.</p>

<p>Dec. 4.—Another delightfully cool morning. There are not a
great many guards here to watch over us, and it would be possible
for all to break away without much trouble. The men, however,
are so sure of liberty that they prefer to wait until given legitimately.
Would like to have seen this guard hold us last summer at
Andersonville. Fresh meat again to-day. Rebels go out to neighboring
plantations and take cattle, drive them here, and butcher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
for us to eat. Rice is also given us to eat. Have plenty of wood
to cook with. Have traded off the old missmated pair of brogans
for a smaller and good pair, and feel quite like a dandy. Have
some money to buy extras. Have plenty of food yet from that
given me at Doctortown. Divide with the Bucks, or rather, it is
all one common mess, and what any one owns belongs equally to
the others. Rebels glum, and cross, and sometimes we laugh at
them, and then they swear and tell us to shut up or they will blow
our heads off. Blackshear is a funny name and it is a funny town,
if there is any, for as yet I haven’t been able to see it. Probably a
barn and a hen-coop comprise the place. Cars go thundering by as
if the Yanks were after them. About every train loaded with
troops. Go first one way and then the other. Think they are trying
to keep out of the way themselves.</p>

<p>Dec. 5.—Guard said that orders were not to talk with any of the
prisoners, and above all not to let us get hold of any newspapers.
No citizens are allowed to come near us. That shows which way
the wind blows. Half a dozen got away from here last night, and
guards more strict to-day, with an increased force. Going to be
moved, it is said, in a few days. Why don’t they run us right into
the ocean? That wouldn’t do though, our gunboats are there.
Well, keep us then, that is punishment enough. Do what you are
a mind to. You dare not starve us now, for we would break away.
In fact, although under guard, we are masters of the situation.
Can see an old darky with an ox hitched to a cart with harness on,
the cart loaded with sugar cane. This is quite a sugar country, it
is said. On the road here saw the famous palmetto tree in groves.
Live-oaks are scattered all over, and are a funny affair. Persimmon
and pecan trees also abound here. We are pretty well south
now, spending the winter. But few die now; no more than would
naturally die in any camp with the same numbers. It is said that
some men get away every night, and it is probably so.</p>

<p>Dec. 6.—Thirteen months ago to-day captured—one year and one
month. Must be something due me from Uncle Sam in wages, by
this time. All come in a lump when it does come. No great loss
without small gain, and while I have been suffering the long imprisonment
my wages have been accumulating. Believe that we
are also entitled to ration money while in prison. Pile it on, you
can’t pay us any too much for this business. This is the land of
the blood hound. Are as common as the ordinary cur at the North.
Are a noble looking dog except when they are after you, and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
they are beastly. Should think that any one of them could whip a
man; are very large, strong, and savage looking. Should think it
would be hard for the negro to run away. See no horses about
here at all—all mules and oxen, and even cows hitched up to draw
loads. I walk the prison over forty times a day. Everybody
knows me, and I hail and am hailed as I walk around, and am
asked what I think of the situation. Tell them of my escape and
the good time I had, which incites them to do likewise the first
opportunity. Occasionally a man here who growls and grumbles,
and says and thinks we will never get away, &amp;c. Some would find
fault if they were going to be hung. Should think they would
compare their condition with that of six months ago and be contented.</p>

<p>Dec. 7.—Another day of smiling weather. Still call our mess
the “Astor House Mess.” It is composed of only three—the Bucks
and myself. I am the only one of the original mess here, and it is
still the most prosperous and best fed of any. We are all the time
at work at something. Have a good piece of soap, and have washed
our clothing throughout, and are clean and neat for prisoners of
war. Eli S. Buck is a large fellow, and a farmer when at home.
Both are young, and from the same neighborhood. As I have said
before, are cousins, and think a great deal of one another, which is
good to see. Relatives rarely get along together in prison as well as
those who are not related. There were brothers in Andersonville
who would not mess together. Seems funny, but such is the case.
Should like to see myself throwing over a brother for any one else.
Guards denounce Jeff Davis as the author of their misfortunes.
We also denounce him as the author of ours, so we are agreed on
one point. Going to move. The “mess” will escape <i lang="fr">en masse</i> at
the first move, just for the sake of roaming the woods. With the
Bucks in company with me, shall have a good time, and we can
undoubtedly soon reach our troops in as much as they are raiding
through the South. Dave Buck is the acknowledged leader of us.
He prays; think of that.</p>

<p>Dec. 8.—There are many men of many minds here. That used
to be a favorite copy at writing school in Jackson, Mich. “Many
men of many minds, many birds of many kinds.” How a person’s
thoughts go back to the old boyhood days in such a place as this.
Happiest times of life are those of youth, but we didn’t know it.
Everybody told us so, but we didn’t believe it; but now it is plain.
Every one, I think, has that experience. We all see where we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
might have done different if we only had our lives to live over, but
alas, it is not to be. A majority of the men here have about half
enough to eat. Our mess has enough to eat, thanks to our own
ingenuity. Now expect to go away from here every day. Have
borrowed a needle, begged some thread, and have been sewing up
my clothing; am well fixed up, as are also the Bucks. Am quite
handy with the needle, and it is difficult to make some of them
believe I am not a tailor by trade. If I always keep my ways mended
as I do my clothes, I shall get along very well. Eli has come
with four large yams bought of a guard and we will proceed to
cook and eat a good supper, and then go to bed and perhaps dream
of something pleasant to remember the next day. Rumors of all
kinds in camp, and rebels say something is up that will interest us,
but I can get no satisfaction as to what it is. Drew cuts for the
extra potato, and Dave won, and he cut that article of food into
three pieces and we all had a share. Good boy.</p>

<p>Dec. 9.—Still in Blackshear, and quiet. Many incidents happened
when I was out in the wood, and I am just crazy to get there
once more. Look at the tall trees in sight, and could hug them.
My long sickness and the terrible place in which I was confined so
long, and my recovering health, and the hope now of getting entirely
well and recovering my liberty, has made a new man of me—a
new lease of life, as it were. The Bucks are the best of fellows,
and having money which they use for my benefit the same as their
own, we get along swimmingly. One of these days my Northern
friends and relatives will hear from me. Am getting over my lameness,
and have an appetite for more than my supply of food. Certainly
had a good constitution to stand all that has been passed
through, during which time thousands and thousands died, of
apparently better health than myself. Of all my many mess-mates
and friends in prison, have lost track of them all; some died, in
fact nearly all, and the balance scattered, the Lord only knows
where. What stories we can talk over when we meet at the North.
This Blackshear country is rather a nice section. Warm and pleasant,
although rather low. Don’t know where we are located, but
must be not far from the coast.</p>

<p>Dec. 10.—The grand change has come and a car load of prisoners
go away from here to-day. Although the Bucks and myself
were the last in prison, we are determined to flank out and go with
the first that go. Our destination is probably Charleston, from
what I can learn. We three will escape on the road, or make a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
desperate effort to do so, anyway. Can walk much better now
than ten days ago, and feel equal to the emergency. Fine weather
and in good spirits, although many here are tired of being moved
from place to place. More guards have come to take charge of us
on the road, and it looks very discouraging for getting away,
although “Dave” says we will make it all right. Place great reliance
in him, as he has caution as well as the intention to escape.
So like Hendryx, and added to it has more practical quiet common
sense. Eli Buck and myself acknowledge him as leader in all
things. Now comes the tug of war.</p>

<p>Dec. 11.—We flanked out this morning, or rather paid three fellows
two dollars apiece for their turn to go. Are now thirty miles
from Blackshear; have been unloaded from the cars and are encamped
by the side of the railroad track for the night. Most dark.
Rebel soldiers going by on the trains, with hoots and yells. We are
strongly guarded, and it augurs not for us to get away to-night.
Our best hold is jumping from the cars. Ride on open platform
cars with guards standing and sitting on the sides, six guards to
each car. About sixty prisoners ride on each car, and there are
thirty or forty cars. Were given rations yesterday, but none to-day.
It is said we get nothing to eat to-night, which is bad; more
so for the other prisoners than ourselves. Low country we come
through, and swampy. Bucks think we may get away before
morning, but I doubt it. Rebs flying around lively, and Yanks
going for them I guess.</p>

<p>Dec. 12.—Routed up at an early hour and loaded on to the cars,
which stood upon a side track, and after being loaded have been
here for six mortal hours. Small rations given us just before loading
up. All are cramped up and mad. We will more than jump
the first opportunity. We go to Charleston, via Savannah. Wish
they would hurry up their old vehicles for transportation. Being
doubled up like a jack knife makes my legs stiff and sore, and difficult
to use my limbs from cramped position. Worth four hundred
dollars a day to see the rebel troops fly around. Would give something
to know the exact position now of both armies. Guards are
sleepy and tired out from doing double duty, and I think we can
get away if they move us by night, which I am afraid they won’t
do. Bucks jubilant and confident, consequently so am I.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In the Woods</span>, Dec 13.—How does that sound for a location
to date from? Yesterday long toward night our train started from
its abiding place and rolled slowly toward its destination, wherever
that might be. When near Savannah, not more than a mile
this side, David Buck jumped off the cars and rolled down the bank.
I jumped next and Eli Buck came right after me. Hastily got up
and joined one another, and hurried off in an easterly direction
through the wet, swampy country. A number of shots were fired
at us, but we were surprised and glad to find that none hit us,
although my cap was knocked off by a bullet hitting the fore-piece.
Eli Buck was also singed by a bullet. It seemed as if a dozen
shots were fired. Train did not stop, and we ran until tired out.
Knew that we were within a line of forts which encircle Savannah,
going all the way around it and only twenty rods or so apart. It
was dark when we jumped off, and we soon came in the vicinity of
a school house in which was being held a negro prayer meeting.
We peeked in at the windows, but dared not stop so near our
jumping off place. Worked around until we were near the railroad
again and guided by the track going south—the same way we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
had come. It was very dark. Dave Buck went ahead, Eli next and
myself last, going Indian file and very slow. All at once Dave
stopped and whispered to us to keep still, which you may be sure
we did. Had come within ten feet of a person who was going
directly in the opposite direction and also stopped, at the same
time we did. Dave Buck says: “Who comes there?” A negro
woman says “it’s me,” and he walked up close to her and asked
where she was going. She says: “Oh! I knows you; you are
Yankees and has jumped off de cars.” By this time we had come
up even with Dave and the woman. Owned up to her that such
was the case. She said we were her friends, and would not tell of
us. Also said that not twenty rods ahead there was a rebel picket,
and we were going right into them. I think if I ever wanted to
kiss a woman, it was that poor, black, negro wench. She told us
to go about thirty rods away and near an old shed, and she would
send us her brother; he would know what to do. We went to the
place designated and waited there an hour, and then we saw two
dusky forms coming through the darkness, and between them a
wooden tray of food consisting of boiled turnips, corn bread and
smoked bacon. We lay there behind that old shed and ate and
talked, and talked and ate, for a full hour more. The negro,
“Major,” said he was working on the forts, putting them in order
to oppose the coming of the Yankees, and he thought he could get
us through the line before morning to a safe hiding place. If we
all shook hands once we did fifty times, all around. The negroes
were fairly jubilant at being able to help genuine Yankees. Were
very smart colored people, knowing more than the ordinary run of
their race. Major said that in all the forts was a reserve picket
force, and between the forts the picket. He said pretty well south
was a dilapidated fort which had not as yet been repaired any, and
that was the one to go through or near, as he did not think there
was any picket there. “Bress de Lord, for yo’ safety,” says the
good woman. We ate all they brought us, and then started under
the guidance of Major at somewhere near midnight. Walked slow
and by a roundabout way to get to the fort and was a long time
about it, going through a large turnip patch and over and through
hedges. Major’s own safety as much as ours depended upon the
trip. Finally came near the fort and discovered there were rebels
inside and a picket off but a few rods. Major left us and crawled
slowly ahead to reconnoitre; returned in a few minutes and told us
to follow. We all climbed over the side of the fort, which was very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
much out of repair. The reserve picket was asleep around a fire
which had nearly gone out. Major piloted us through the fort,
actually stepping over the sleeping rebels. After getting on the
outside there was a wide ditch which we went through. Ditch
was partially full of water. We then went way round near the railroad
again, and started south, guided by the darky, who hurried us
along at a rapid gait. By near daylight we were five or six miles
from Savannah, and then stopped for consultation and rest. Finally
went a mile further, where we are now laying low in a swamp,
pretty well tired out and muddy beyond recognition. Major left us
at daylight, saying he would find us a guide before night who
would show us still further. He had to go back and work on the
forts. And so I am again loose, a free man, with the same old feeling
I had when in the woods before. We got out of a thick settled
country safely, and again await developments. Heard drums and
bugles playing reveille this morning in many directions, and “We
are all surrounded.” David Buck is very confident of getting away
to our lines. Eli thinks it is so if Dave says so, and I don’t know,
or care so very much. The main point with me is to stay out in
the woods as long as I can. My old legs have had a hard time of it
since last night and ache, and are very lame. It’s another beautiful
and cold day, this 13th of December. Biting frost nights, but
warmer in the day time. Our plan is to work our way to the Ogechee
River, and wait for the Stars and Stripes to come to us. Major
said Sherman was marching right toward us all the time, driving
the rebel army with no trouble at all. Told us to keep our ears
open and we would hear cannon one of these days, possibly within
a week. The excitement of the last twenty-four hours has worn
me out, and I couldn’t travel to-day if it was necessary. Have a
plenty to eat, and for a wonder I ain’t hungry for anything except
things we haven’t got. Dave is happy as an oyster, and wants to
yell. Where they are so confident I am satisfied all will be well.
As soon as it comes night we are going up to some negro huts less
than a mile off, where we hope and expect that Major has posted
the inmates in regard to us. The railroad is only a short distance
off, and the river only three or four miles. As near as we know,
are about twenty miles from the Atlantic coast. Tell the boys it
may be necessary for me to stay here for two or three days to get
recruited up, but they think three or four miles to-night will do me
good. Don’t like to burden them and shall try it.</p>

<p>Dec. 14.—We are now three miles from yesterday’s resting place,
and near the Miller plantation. Soon as dark last night we went
to the negro huts and found them expecting us. Had a jubilee.
No whites near, but all away. The Buck boys passed near here
before when out in the woods, and knew of many darkys who
befriended them. Had a surfeit of food. Stayed at the huts until
after midnight, and then a woman brought us to this place. To-night
we go to Jocko’s hut, across the river. A darky will row us
across the Little Ogechee to Jocco’s hut, and then he will take us in
tow. It is a rice country about here, with canals running every
way. Negroes all tickled to death because Yankees coming. I am
feeling better than yesterday, but difficult to travel. Tell the boys
they had better leave me with the friendly blacks and go ahead to
our lines, but they won’t. Plenty to eat and milk to drink, which
is just what I want. The whites now are all away from their homes
and most of the negroes. Imagine we can hear the booming of
cannon, but guess we are mistaken. Dave is very entertaining and
good company. Don’t get tired of him and his talk. Both of them
are in rebel dress throughout, and can talk and act just like rebels.
Know the commanders of different rebel regiments. They say that
when out before they on different occasions mixed with the Southern
army, without detection. Said they didn’t wonder the widow
woman knew I was a Yankee. Ain’t up to that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Dec. 15.—Jocko’s hut was not across the river as I supposed and
wrote yesterday, but on the same side we were on. At about ten
o’clock last night we went to his abiding place as directed and
knocked. After a long time an old black head was stuck out of
the window with a nightcap on. The owner of the head didn’t
know Jocko or anything about him; was short and crusty; said:
“Go way from dar!” Kept talking to him and he scolding at being
disturbed. Said he had rheumatics and couldn’t get out to let
us in. After a long time opened the door and we set down on the
door step. Told him we were yankees and wanted help. Was the
funniest darky we have met yet. Would give something for his
picture as he was framed in his window in the moonlight talking
to us, with the picturesque surroundings, and us yankees trying to
win him over to aid us. Finally owned up that he was Jocko, but
said he couldn’t row us across the river. He was lame and could
not walk, had no boat, and if he had the river was so swift he
couldn’t get us across, and if it wasn’t swift, the rebels would catch
him at it and hang him. Talked a long time and with much teasing.
By degrees his scruples gave way, one at a time. Didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
know but he might row us across if he only had a boat, and finally
didn’t know but he could find a boat. To get thus far into his
good graces took at least three hours. Went looking around and
found an old scow, fixed up some old oars, and we got in; before
doing so however, he had warmed up enough to give us some boiled
sweet potatoes and cold baked fish. Rowed us way down the river
and landed us on the noted Miller plantation and a mile in rear of
the negro houses. Jocko, after we forced our acquaintance on him
with all kind of argument, proved to be a smart able-bodied old
negro, but awful afraid of being caught helping runaways. Would
give something for his picture as he appeared to us looking out of
his cabin window. Just an old fashioned, genuine negro, and so
black that charcoal would make a white mark on him. Took us
probably three miles from his hut, two miles of water and one of
land, and then started back home after shaking us a dozen times
by the hand, and “God blessing us.” Said “Ole Massa Miller’s niggers
all Union niggers,” and to go up to the huts in broad daylight
and they would help us. No whites at home on the plantation.
We arrived where Jocko left us an hour or so before daylight, and
lay down to sleep until light. I woke up after a while feeling wet,
and found the tide had risen and we were surrounded with water;
woke up the boys and scrambled out of that in a hurry, going
through two feet of water in some places. The spot where we had
laid down was a higher piece of ground than that adjoining. Got
on to dry land and proceeded to get dry. At about ten o’clock
Dave went up to the negro huts and made himself known, which
was hard work. The negroes are all afraid that we are rebels and
trying to get them into a scrape, but after we once get them
thoroughly satisfied that we are genuine Yanks they are all right,
and will do anything for us. The negroes have shown us the big
house, there being no whites around, they having left to escape the
coming Yankee army. We went up into the cupola and looked
way off on the ocean, and saw our own noble gunboats. What
would we give to be aboard of them? Their close proximity makes
us discuss the feasibility of going down the river and out to them,
but the negroes say there are chain boats across the river farther
down, and picketed. Still it makes us anxious, our being so near,
and we have decided to go down the river to-night in a boat and
see if we can’t reach them. It is now the middle of the afternoon
and we lay off from the huts eighty rods, and the negroes are about
to bring us some dinner. During the night we traveled over oyster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
beds by the acre, artificial ones, and they cut our feet. Negroes
say there are two other runaways hid a mile off and they are going
to bring them to our abiding place. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Negroes have just
fed us with corn bread and a kind of fish about the size of sardines,
boiled by the kettle full, and they are nice. Fully as good as sardines.
Think I know now where nearly all the imported sardines
come from. Negroes catch them by the thousand, in nets, put
them in kettles, and cook them a few minutes, when they are ready
to eat. Scoop them out of the creeks. The two other runaways
are here with us. They are out of the 3d Ohio Cavalry. Have
been out in the woods for two weeks. Escaped from Blackshear
and traveled this far. I used to know one of them in Savannah.
We do not take to them at all, as they are not of our kind. Shall
separate to-night, they going their way and we going ours. Have
secured a dug-out boat to go down the Ogechee River with to-night.
The negroes tell us of a Mr. Kimball, a white man, living up the
country fifteen miles, who is a Union man, and helps runaways, or
any one of Union proclivities. He lays up the river, and our gunboats
lay down the river. Both have wonderful charms for us, and
shall decide before night which route to take. Are on rice plantation,
and a valuable one. Before the “wah” there were over fifteen
hundred negroes on this place. Cotton is also part of the production.
Have decided to go down the river and try to reach our gunboats.
It’s a very hazardous undertaking, and I have my doubts
as to its successful termination.</p>

<p>Dec. 16.—Another adventure, and a red hot one. Started down
the river in our dug-out boat somewhere near midnight. Ran down
all right for an hour, frequently seeing rebel pickets and camp
fires. Saw we were going right into the lion’s mouth, as the farther
down the more rebels. All at once our boat gave a lurch and
landed in a tree top which was sticking out of the water, and there
we were, swaying around in the cold water in the middle or near
the middle of the Ogechee. Dave went ashore and to a negro hut,
woke up the inmates, and narrated our troubles. A negro got up,
and with another boat came to the rescue. Were about froze with
the cold and wet. Said not more than a mile farther down we
would have run right into a chain boat, with pickets posted on it.
It really seems as if a Divine providence were guiding us. After
getting a breakfast of good things started off toward the Big Ogechee
River, and have traveled three or four miles. Are now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
encamped, or rather laying down, on a little hillock waiting for
evening, to get out of this vicinity which is a dangerous one. In
our river escapade lost many of our things, but still hang to my
coverlid and diary. There are three or four houses in view, and
principally white residences, those of the poor white trash order,
and they are the very ones we must avoid. Have caught cold and
am fearfully out of traveling condition, but must go it now. A
mistake in coming down the river. Am resting up, preparatory to
traveling all night up the country. No chance of getting out by
the coast. Have enough food to last all day and night, and that is
a good deal. Can’t carry more than a day’s supply. Have now
been out in the woods, this is the fourth day, and every day has
been fresh adventures thick and fast. If I could only travel like
my comrades, would get along. Bucks praise me up and encourage
me to work away, and I do. For breakfast had more of those
imported sardines. Storm brewing of some sort and quite chilly.
Saw rebel infantry marching along the highway not more than
eighty rods off. Hugged the ground very close. Dogs came very
near us, and if they had seen us would have attracted the rebels’
attention. Am writing with a pencil less than an inch long. Shall
print this diary and make my everlasting fortune, and when wealthy
will visit this country and make every negro who has helped
us millionaires. Could not move from here half a mile by daylight
without being seen, and as a consequence we are feeling very sore
on the situation. Don’t know but I shall be so lame to-night that I
cannot walk at all, and then the boys must leave me and go ahead
for themselves. However, they say I am worth a hundred dead
men yet, and will prod me along like a tired ox. Dave goes now
bareheaded, or not quite so bad as that, as he has a handkerchief
tied over his head. The programme now is to go as straight to Mr.
Kimball’s as we can. He is probably twenty miles away; is a white
Union man I spoke of a day or so ago in this same diary. Will
stick to him like a brother. Can hear wagons go along the road
toward Savannah, which is only thirteen or fourteen miles away.
<span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Most dark enough to travel and I have straightened up
and am taking an inventory of myself. Find I can walk with the
greatest difficulty. The boys argue that after I get warmed up I
will go like a top, and we will see.</p>

<p>Dec. 17.—And another day of vicissitudes. We traveled last
night about four miles, piloted by a young negro. It was a terrible
walk to me; slow and painful. Were fed, and have food for to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
Are now about three miles from a canal which we must cross before
another morning. Negroes say “Sherman most here” and “Bress de
Lord!” Mr. Kimball lives nine miles away and we must reach him
some way, but it seems an impossibility for me to go so far. Are
now in a high and fine country, but too open for us. Have to lay
down all day in the bushes. David is a thorough scout. Goes
crawling around on his hands and knees taking in his bearings.
Troops are encamped on the main road. Every cross road has its
pickets, and it is slow business to escape running into them. Eli S.
Buck has a sore throat and is hoarse. Pretty good jaunt for him,
tough as he is. Shall have no guide to-night, as Dave thinks he can
engineer us all right in the right direction. Some thinks he will
leave us both and reach Kimball’s to-night, and then come back and
see us through. Guess I will be on hand to go along however.</p>

<p>Dec. 18.—Six days of freedom and what a sight of hardship,
sweetened by kind treatment and the satisfaction of being out from
under guard. We traveled last night some four miles and now are
in a very precarious position. When almost daylight we came to the
canal, and found cavalry pickets all along the tow-path; walked
along until we came to a lock. A cavalryman was riding his horse
up and down by the lock. At the lock there was a smouldering fire.
It was absolutely necessary that we get across before daylight. As
the mounted picket turned his horse’s head to go from us, Dave slid
across the tow-path and went across the timbers which formed the
lock, and by the time the picket turned around to come back Dave
was hid on the opposite shore. At the next trip of the rebel Eli
went the same as Dave. The third one to go was myself, and I expected
to get caught, sure. Could not go as quiet as the rest,
and was slower. Thought the picket saw me when half way across
but kept right on going, and for a wonder made it all right. Was
thoroughly scared for the first time since jumping off the train. Am
very nervous. All shook hands when the picket turned about to go
back the fourth time. Getting light in the east and we must move
on, as the country is very open. Dare not travel over half a mile,
and here we are hid almost in a woman’s door yard, not over thirty
rods from her very door. Are in some evergreen bushes and shrubs.
It’s now most noon, and have seen a rather elderly lady go out and
in the house a number of times. The intrepid Dave is going up to
the house to interview the lady soon. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Dave crawled along
from our hiding place until he came to the open ground, and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
straightened boldly up and walked to the house. In fifteen minutes
he came back with some bread and dried beef, and said the woman
was a Union woman and would help us. Her daughter slept at her
uncle’s a mile off last night, and expected her back soon, and perhaps
the uncle, who is a violent Secesh, with her. Said for us to
lay low. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—The daughter came home on horseback and
alone. Could see the old lady telling the daughter about us and
pointing our way. About the middle of the afternoon the old lady
started out toward us. Behind her came a young darky, and behind
the darky came another darky; then a dog, then a white boy, then a
darky, and then the daughter. Old lady peeked in, and so did the
rest except the grown-up girl, who was too afraid. Finally came
closer, and as she got a good view of us she says: “Why, mother,
they look just like anybody else.” She had never seen a Yankee
before. Brought us some more food, and after dark will set a table
for us to come to the house and eat. Her name is Mrs. Dickinson.
They went back to the house and we proceeded to shake hands with
one another. During the afternoon five rebel soldiers came to the
house, one at a time. It is now most dark and we are about ready
to go to the house and eat. Mr. Kimball lives only four miles away.</p>

<p>Dec. 19.—We are now less than half a mile from Mr. Kimball’s.
After dark last night we went to Mrs. Dickinson’s house and partook
of a splendid supper. I wrote a paper directed to the officer commanding
the first Yankee troops that should arrive here telling what
she had done for us runaway Yankees. She talked a great deal, and
I thought was careless leaving the front door open. Three or four
times I got up and shut that door. We had taken off our blankets
and other wraps and left them in a sort of a kitchen, and were talking
in the best room. I heard the gate click, and on looking out
saw two rebel officers coming to the house and not six rods off. We
jumped into the other room and out of the back door and behind a
corn house, bare headed. The officers were asked into the front
room by the daughter. They asked who the parties were who ran
out of the back way. She said she reckoned no one. They kept at
her and jokingly intimated that some of her skulking lovers had
been to see her. She kept talking back and finally said: “Mother,
did any one just go away?” And the old lady said: “Why, yes,
brother Sam and his ‘boy’ just went off home.” Them confounded
rebels had come to see the girl and spend the evening, and we shivering
out in the cold. Joked her for an hour and a half about her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
lovers and we hearing every word. Finally they got up and bid her
good night, saying they would send back some men to guard the
house and keep her lovers away. Just as soon as they were down
the road a ways, the daughter came out very frightened and said for
us to hurry off, as they would send back troops to look for us. Hurried
into the house, got our things and some dried beef, and started
off toward Mr. Kimball’s house. Reached here just before daylight
and lay down back of the house about eighty rods, in the corner of
the fence, to sleep a little before morning. Just at break of day heard
some one calling hogs. David got up and went toward an old man
whom we knew was our friend Kimball. Came to us, and was glad
to shake hands with genuine Yankees. Said one of his neighbors
was coming over early to go with him to hunt some hogs, and for us
to go farther off and stay until night, and he would think up during
the day what to do with us. Did not want anything to eat. Came
to this place where we now are, and feeling that our journey was
most ended. Mr. Kimball said that Sherman was not over fifty
miles off, and coming right along twenty miles per day, and our plan
was to hide and await coming events. Mr. Kimball is an old man,
probably sixty years old, white haired and stoop shouldered. He
had five sons, all drafted into the rebel army. All refused to serve.
Two have been shot by the rebels, one is in some prison for his Union
proclivities, and two are refugees. The old man has been imprisoned
time and again, his stock confiscated, property destroyed, and all
together had a hard time of it. Still he is true blue, a Union man to
the back bone. Really think our troubles coming to an end. Kimball
said: “Glory to God, the old Stars and Stripes shall float over
my house in less than a week!” It’s a noble man who will stand out
through all that he has, for his principles, when his interests are all
here. Is not only willing, but glad to help us, and says anything he
has is ours, if it will help us toward our escape. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Have
been laying all day watching Kimball’s house. Along in the morning
the neighbor spoken of came to Kimball’s, and they both went off
on horseback to shoot hogs. The swine here roam over a large territory
and become most wild, and when they want fresh pork they
have to go after it with a gun. You may be sure the hunters did not
come near us with Mr. Kimball for a guide. A negro boy went with
them with a light wagon and mule attached. Near noon they returned
with some killed hogs in the wagon. At three or four o’clock
the old man came down where we were “to look after his boys,” he
said. Is in the best of spirits. Says we are to hide to-night where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
he tells us, and stay until our troops reach us. That is jolly good
news for me, as I hate to travel. Said come to the house after dark
and he would have a supper prepared for us, and has just left us.
<span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Have just eaten a splendid supper at Kimball’s and getting
ready to travel three miles to a safe hiding place.</p>

<p>Dec. 20.—Well, we are just well fixed and happy. After partaking
of a royal repast last night, served in an out-building near the
main building of the Kimball home, we were directed to this place
which is on the banks of the Big Ogechee river, in a most delightful
spot. While we were at Kimball’s he had negro sentinels stationed
at different points on the plantation to announce the coming of any
rebel soldiers or citizens that might see fit to come near. He gave us
an axe, a quart of salt, a ham too big to carry conveniently, and all
the sweet potatoes we could drag along; also a butcher knife. Went
with us a mile as guide and then told us so we found the place pointed
out. Also gave us some shelled corn to bait hogs and told Dave
how to make a deadfall to catch them. We left the main road going
directly West until we came to a fence, then turned to the left and
followed the line of the fence, and when we had got to the end of it
kept straight ahead going through a swampy low section. After a
while came to higher and dry land and to the banks of the river. Is
a sort of an island, and as I said before, a very pretty and pleasant
spot. Out in the river grows tall canebrake which effectually
hides us from any one going either up or down the river. Tall pines
are here in abundance and nice grass plats, with as handsome palm
clusters as ever I saw. Are going to build us a house to keep off the
cold and rain. Have matches and a rousing fire cooked our breakfast
of nice ham and sweet potatoes. We also roasted some corn and
had corn coffee. Any quantity of hogs running around and Dave is
already thinking of a trap to catch them. It will be necessary for
we are making that ham look sick. Eat so much breakfast that we
can hardly walk and don’t know but will commit suicide by eating.
Buzzards fly around attracted by the cooking. Are as large and look
like turkeys. Our government should give to Mr. Kimball a fortune
for his patriotism and sacrifices to the Union cause. About eight
miles above is a long bridge across the river and there it is thought
a big fight will take place when Sherman attempts to cross, and so we
will know when they approach, as we could hear a battle that distance.
<span class="smcap">Night.</span>—We have built the cosyest and nicest little house to
lay in. Cut poles with the axe and made a frame, and then covered
the top with palm leaves just like shingles on a house at the North,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
then fixed three sides the same way, each leaf overlapping the other,
and the fourth side open to a fire and the river. The water is cold
and clear and nice to drink; just like spring water. Have eaten the
ham half up; ditto potatoes. The increased prosperity makes me
feel well bodily, and mentally am more so. It is still the “Astor
House Mess.” We all cook, and we all eat. Dave prays to-night as
he does every night and morning, and I ain’t sure but all through
the day. Is a thorough Christian if ever there was one. I also wrote
a letter for Mr. Kimball to the commanding Union officer who may
first approach these parts. In it I told how he had befriended us
and others. We heard boats going by on the river to-day. At such
times all we do is to keep still, as no one can see us. Rebels are too
busy to look for us or any one else. All they can do now to take
care of themselves. Eli is making up our bed, getting ready to turn
in. I have just brought a tin pail of nice water and we all drink.
Take off our shoes for the first time in some days. A beautiful night—clear
and cold. And thus ends another day, and we are in safety.</p>

<p>Dec. 21.—Got up bright and early. Never slept better. Getting
rested up. We talk continually. Both Bucks are great talkers,
especially David. Cooked and ate our breakfast, and would you
believe it the ham is all gone. Incredible, the amount of food we
eat. Wonder it don’t make us all sick. Sweet potatoes getting low.
Dave fixing up his deadfall for hogs. Has rolled some heavy logs
together forty rods away from our house, and fixed up a figure four
spring trap, with the logs for weight to hold down the animal which
may be enticed into it. Has scattered corn in and around the trap,
and we wait for developments. Hogs are very shy of us and surroundings.
Are apparently fat and in good order. Plenty of roots
and shack which they eat, and thrive thereon. Buzzards are very
curious in regard to us. They light on the limbs in the trees, and if
their support is a dead limb it breaks and makes a great noise in the
still woods. Two or three hundred all together make a terrible
racket, and scare us sometimes. The weather is very fine, and this
must be a healthy climate. Dave is going out to-day to look around.
As I have said before, he is a scout and understands spying around,
and won’t get caught. If we had a fish hook and line or a net of
some sort could catch fish to eat. That would be a grand sport
as we can see nice large fish in the water. The main road is away
about one and a half miles we think by the sound of the teams which
occasionally rumble along. Often hear shouting on the road as if cattle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
were being driven along toward Savannah. Once in a while we
hear guns fired off, but it is no doubt hogs being killed. We also
hear folks going up and down the river, but cannot see them. After
dark we have no fire as that would expose us, it is so much plainer
to be seen in the night. The river is wide; should think a third of
a mile, as we can view it from away up the stream. The cane
that grows in the river is the same as we have for fish poles at the
North, and are shipped from the South. Have added some repairs
to the house and it is now water tight, we think. Made a bed of
soft boughs, and with our three blankets have a good sleeping place.
Dave got a tall cane and fastened up on the house, and for a flag
fastened on a piece of black cloth—the best we could do. That
means no quarter; and it is just about what we mean, too. Don’t
believe we would be taken very easy now. I am getting fat every
day, yet lame, and have come to the conclusion that it will be a long
time before I get over it. The cords have contracted so in my right
leg that they don’t seem to stretch out again to their original length.
That scurvy business came very near killing me. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—I also
went out of our hiding place, and saw away out in a field what I
took to be a mound where sweet potatoes were buried. Came back
and got a pair of drawers, tied the bottom of the legs together, and
sallied forth. The mound of potatoes was a good way back from
the house, although in plain sight. I crawled up, and began digging
into it with a piece of canteen. Very soon had a hole in, and found
some of the nicest potatoes that you can imagine, of the red variety,
which I believe are the genuine Southern yam. Filled the drawers
cram full, filled my pockets and got all I could possibly carry, then
closed up the hole and worked my way back to camp. Eli was
alone, Dave not having returned from his scouting trip. Had a war
dance around those potatoes. Believe there is a bushel of them, and
like to have killed myself getting them here. After I got into the
woods and out of the field, straightened up and got the drawers
on my shoulders and picked the way to head-quarters. We don’t
any of us call any such thing as that stealing. It’s one of the necessities
of our lives that we should have food, and if we have not
got it, must do the best we can. Now if we can catch a porker will
be fixed all right for some days to come. Think it is about the time
of year for butchering. We don’t expect to be here more than two
or three days at fartherest, although I shall hate to leave this beautiful
spot, our nice house and all. Listen all the time for the expected
battle at the bridge, and at any unusual sound of commotion in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
that direction we are all excitement. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Dave has returned.
He went to the main road and saw a negro. Was lucky enough to
get a Savannah paper three days old in which there was nothing we
did not know in regard to Sherman’s coming. The negro said yankee
scouts had been seen just across the river near the bridge, and
the main army is expected every day. The rebels will fall back
across the river and contest the crossing. Fortifications are built all
along clear to Savannah, and it may be reasonably expected that
some hard fighting will take place. Savannah is the pride of the
South and they will not easily give it up. Dave did not tell the negro
that he was a yankee, but represented himself as a conscript hiding
in the woods to keep from fighting in the rebel army. Was glad
to see supply of potatoes and says I will do. Has freshly baited his
trap for hogs and thinks before night we will have fresh pork to go
with the potatoes. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—We went around a drove of hogs and
gradually and carefully worked them up to the trap. Pretty soon
they began to pick up the corn and one of them went under the figure
four, sprung it and down came the logs and such a squealing and
scrambling of those not caught. The axe had been left near the trap
standing up against a tree, and Dave ran up and grabbed it and
struck the animal on the head and cut his throat. How we did
laugh and dance around that defunct porker. Exciting sport this
trapping for fresh pork. In half an hour Dave and Eli had the pig
skinned and dressed. Is not a large one probably weighs ninety
pounds or so, and is fat and nice. Have sliced up enough for about
a dozen men and are now cooking it on sticks held up before the fire.
Also frying some in a skillet which we are the possessor of. When
the hogs run wild and eat acorns, roots and the like, the meat is
tough and curly but is sweet and good. We fry out the grease and
then slice up the potatoes and cook in it. Thanks to Mr. Kimball
we have plenty of salt to season our meat with. The buzzards are
after their share which will be small. And now it is most night
again and the “Astor House” larder is full. Seems too bad to go
to bed with anything to eat on hand, but must. That is the feeling
with men who have been starved so long, cannot rest in peace with
food laying around. My two comrades are not so bad about that as
I am, having been well fed for a longer period. Have sat up three
or four hours after dark, talking over what we will do when we get
home, and will now turn in for a sound sleep. It’s a clear moonlight
night, and we can hear very plain a long distance. Can also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
see the light shining from camp fires in many directions, or what we
take to be such.</p>

<p>Dec. 22.—As Dan Rice used to say in the circus ring: “Here we
are again.” Sleep so sound that all the battles in America could not
wake me up. Are just going for that fresh pork to-day. Have three
kinds of meat—fried pig, roast pork and broiled hog. Good any
way you can fix it. Won’t last us three days at this rate, and if we
stay long enough will eat up all the hogs in these woods. Pretty
hoggish on our part, and Dave says for gracious sake not to write
down how much we eat, but as this diary is to be a record of what
takes place, down it goes how much we eat. Tell him that inasmuch
as we have a preacher along with us, we ought to have a sermon
occasionally. Says he will preach if I will sing, and I
agree to that if Eli will take up a collection. One objection Eli and
I have to his prayers is the fact that he wants the rebels saved with
the rest, yet don’t tell him so. Mutually agree that his prayers are
that much too long. Asked him if he thought it stealing to get those
potatoes as I did, and he says no, and that he will go next time. We
begin to expect the Yankees along. It’s about time. Don’t know
what I shall do when I again see Union soldiers with guns in their
hands, and behold the Stars and Stripes. Probably go crazy, or
daft, or something. This is a cloudy, chilly day, and we putter
around gathering up pine knots for the fire, wash our duds and otherwise
busy ourselves. Have saved the hog skin to make moccasins
of, if the Union army is whipped and we have to stay here eight or
ten years. The hair on our heads is getting long again, and we begin
to look like wild men of the woods. One pocket comb does for
the entire party; two jack knives and a butcher knife. I have four
keys jingling away in my pocket to remind me of olden times. Eli
has a testament and Dave has a bible, and the writer hereof has not.
Still, I get scripture quoted at all hours, which will, perhaps, make
up in a measure. Am at liberty to use either one of their books, and
I do read more or less. Considerable travel on the highways, and
going both ways as near as we can judge. Dave wants to go out to
the road again but we discourage him in it, and he gives it up for to-day
at least. Are afraid he will get caught, and then our main stay
will be gone. Pitch pine knots make a great smoke which rises
among the trees and we are a little afraid of the consequences; still,
rebels have plenty to do now without looking us up. Many boats go
up and down the river and can hear them talk perhaps fifty rods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
away. Rebel paper that Dave got spoke of Savannah being the point
aimed at by Sherman, also of his repulses; still I notice that he keeps
coming right along. Also quoted part of a speech by Jefferson
Davis, and he is criticised unmercifully. Says nothing about any
exchange of prisoners, and our old comrades are no doubt languishing
in some prison. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Considerable firing up in vicinity of
the bridge. Can hear volleys of musketry, and an occasional boom
of cannon. Hurrah! It is now four o’clock by the sun and the battle
is certainly taking place. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Go it Billy Sherman, we are
listening and wishing you the best of success. Come right along and
we will be with you. Give ’em another—that was a good one. We
couldn’t be more excited if we were right in the midst of it. Hurrah!
It is now warm for the Johnnies. If we had guns would go
out and fight in their rear; surround them, as it were. Troops
going by to the front, and are cavalry, should think, also artillery.
Can hear teamsters swearing away as they always do. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—It is
now long after dark and we have a good fire. Fighting has partially
subsided up the river, but of course we don’t know whether Yankee
troops have crossed the river or not. Great deal of travel on the
road, but can hardly tell which way they are going. Occasional firing.
No sleep for us to-night. In the morning shall go out to the
road and see how things look. Every little while when the battle
raged the loudest, all of us three would hurrah as if mad, but we
ain’t mad a bit; are tickled most to death.</p>

<p>Dec. 23.—It is not yet daylight in the morning, and are anxiously
awaiting the hour to arrive when we may go out to the road. Slept
hardly any during the night. More or less fighting all night, and
could hear an army go by toward Savannah, also some shouting directly
opposite us. Between the hours of about twelve and three
all was quiet, and then again more travel. We conjecture that the
rebel army has retreated or been driven back, and that the Yankees
are now passing along following them up. Shall go out about nine
o’clock. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—Are eating breakfast before starting out to liberty
and safety. Must be very careful now and make no mistake. If we
run into a rebel squad now, might get shot. We are nervous, and so
anxious can hardly eat. Will pick up what we really need and start.
Perhaps good bye, little house on the banks of the Ogechee, we shall
always remember just how you look, and what a happy time we have
had on this little island. Dave says: “Pick up your blanket and
that skillet, and come along.” <span class="smcap">Night.</span>—Safe and sound among our
own United States Army troops, after an imprisonment of nearly
fourteen months. Will not attempt to describe my feelings now.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Could not do it. Staying with the 80th Ohio Infantry, and are pretty
well tired out from our exertions of the day. At nine o’clock we
started out toward the main road. When near it Eli and I stopped,
and Dave went ahead to see who was passing. We waited probably
fifteen minutes, and then heard Dave yell out: “Come on boys, all
right! Hurry up!” Eli and I had a stream to cross on a log. The
stream was some fifteen feet wide, and the log about two feet
through. I tried to walk that log and fell in my excitement. Verily
believe if the water had been a foot deeper I would have drowned.
Was up to my arms, and I was so excited that I liked never to have
got out. Lost the axe, which Dave had handed to me, and the old
stand-by coverlid which had saved my life time and again floated off
down the stream, and I went off without securing it—the more
shame to me for it. Dave ran out of the woods swinging his arms
and yelling like mad, and pretty soon Eli and myself appeared,
whooping and yelling. The 80th Ohio was just going by, or a portion
of it, however, and when they saw first one and then another
and then the third coming toward them in rebel dress, with clubs
which they mistook for guns, they wheeled into line, thinking, perhaps,
that a whole regiment would appear next. Dave finally
explained by signs, and we approached and satisfied them of our
genuineness. Said we were hard looking soldiers, but when we
came to tell them where we had been and all the particulars, they
did not wonder. Went right along with them, and at noon had
plenty to eat. Are the guests of Co. I, 80th Ohio. At three the
80th had a skirmish, we staying back a mile with some wagons, and
this afternoon rode in a wagon. Only came about three or four
miles to-day, and are near Kimball’s, whom we shall call and see the
first opportunity. The soldiers all look well and feel well, and say
the whole confederacy is about cleaned out. Rebels fall back without
much fighting. Said there was not enough to call it a fight at the
bridge. Where we thought it a battle, they thought it nothing worth
speaking of. Believe ten or so were killed, and some wounded.
Hear that some Michigan cavalry is with Kilpatrick off on another
road, but they do not know whether it is the 9th Mich. Cav., or not.
Say they see the cavalry every day nearly, and I must keep watch
for my regiment. Soldiers forage on the plantations, and have the
best of food; chickens, ducks, sweet potatoes, etc. The supply
wagons carry nothing but hard-tack, coffee, sugar and such things.
Tell you, coffee is a luxury, and makes one feel almost drunk. Officers
come to interview us every five minutes, and we have talked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
ourselves most to death to-day. They say we probably will not be
called upon to do any fighting during this war, as the thing is about
settled. They have heard of Andersonville, and from the accounts
of the place did not suppose that any lived at all. New York papers
had pictures in, of the scenes there, and if such was the case it seems
funny that measures were not taken to get us away from there.
Many rebels are captured now, and we look at them from a different
stand point than a short time since.</p>

<p>Dec. 24.—This diary must soon come to an end. Will fill the
few remaining pages and then stop. Co. “I” boys are very kind.
They have reduced soldiering to a science. All divided up into
messes of from three to five each. Any mess is glad to have us in
with them, and we pay them with accounts of our prison life.
Know they think half we tell them is lies. I regret the most of anything,
the loss of my blanket that stood by me so well. It’s a singular
fact that the first day of my imprisonment it came into my
possession, and the very last day it took its departure, floating off
away from me after having performed its mission. Should like to
have taken it North to exhibit to my friends. The infantry move
only a few miles each day, and I believe we stay here all day. Went
and saw Mr. Kimball. The officers commanding knew him for a
Union man, and none of his belongings were troubled. In fact, he
has anything he wants now. Announces his intention of going
with the army until the war closes. Our good old friend Mrs. Dickinson
did not fare so well. The soldiers took everything she had on
the place fit to eat; all her cattle, pork, potatoes, chickens, and left
them entirely destitute. We went and saw them, and will go to head-quarters
to see what can be done. <span class="smcap">Later.</span>—We went to Gen. Smith,
commanding 3d Brigade, 2d Division, and told him the particulars.
He sent out foraging wagons, and now she has potatoes, corn, bacon,
cattle, mules, and everything she wants. Also received pay for
burned fences and other damages. Now they are smiling and happy
and declare the Yankees to be as good as she thought them bad this
morning. The men being under little restraint on this raid were often
destructive. Nearly every citizen declared their loyalty, so no
distinction is made. Gen. Smith is a very kind man, and asked us a
great many questions. Says the 9th Michigan Cavalry is near us and
we may see them any hour. Gen. Haun also takes quite an interest
in us, and was equally instrumental with Gen. Smith in seeing justice
done to our friends the Kimballs and Dickinsons. They declare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
now that one of us must marry the daughter of Mrs. Dickinson, the
chaplain performing the ceremony. Well, she is a good girl, and I
should judge would make a good wife, but presume she would have
something to say herself and will not pop the question to her. They
are very grateful, and only afraid that after we all go away the rebel
citizens and soldiers will retaliate on them. Many officers have read
portions of my diary, and say such scenes as we have passed through
seem incredible. Many inquire if we saw so and so of their friends
who went to Andersonville, but of course there were so many there
that we cannot remember them. This has been comparatively a day
of rest for this portion of the Union army, after having successfully
crossed the river. We hear the cavalry is doing some fighting on the
right, in the direction of Fort McAllister. <span class="smcap">Evening.</span>—We marched
about two or three miles and are again encamped for the night, with
pickets out for miles around. Many refugees join the army prepared
to go along with them, among whom are a great many negroes.</p>

<p>Dec. 25.—Christmas day and didn’t hang up my stocking. No
matter, it wouldn’t have held anything. Last Christmas we spent on
Belle Island, little thinking long imprisonment awaiting us. Us escaped
men are to ride in a forage wagon. The army is getting ready
to move. Are now twenty-four miles from Savannah and rebels
falling back as we press ahead. <span class="smcap">Night.</span>—At about nine o’clock this
morning as we sat in the forage wagon top of some corn riding in
state, I saw some cavalry coming from the front. Soon recognized
Col. Acker at the head of the 9th Michigan Cavalry. Jumped out
of the wagon and began dancing and yelling in the middle of the
road and in front of the troop. Col. Acker said: “Get out of the
road you —— lunatic!” Soon made myself known and was like
one arisen from the dead. Major Brockway said: “Ransom, you want
to start for home. We don’t know you, you are dead. No such
man as Ransom on the rolls for ten months.” All remember
me and are rejoiced to see me back again. Lieut. Col. Way, Surgeon,
Adjutant, Sergeant-Major, all shake hands with me. My company
“A” was in the rear of the column, and I stood by the road as they
moved along, hailing those I recognized. In every case had to tell
them who I was and then would go up and shake hands with them
at the risk of getting stepped on by the horses. Pretty soon Co. “A”
appeared, and wasn’t they surprised to see me. The whole company
were raised in Jackson, Mich., my home, and I had been regarded as
dead for nearly a year. Could hardly believe it was myself that appeared
to them. Every one trying to tell me the news at home all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
at the same time—how I was reported as having died in Richmond
and funeral sermon preached. How so and so had been shot and
killed, &amp;c., &amp;c. And then I had to tell them of who of our regiment
had died in Andersonville—Dr. Lewis, Tom McGill and others.
Although Jimmy Devers did not belong to our regiment, many in our
company knew him, and I told them of his death. Should have said
that as soon as I got to the company, was given Capt. Johnson’s lead
horse to ride, without saddle or bridle and nothing but a halter to
hang on with. Not being used to riding, in rebel dress—two or three
pails hanging to me—I made a spectacle for them all to laugh at. It
was a time of rejoicing. The Buck boys did not get out of the wagon
with me and so we became separated without even a good bye.
Before I had been with the company half an hour Gen. Kilpatrick
and staff came riding by from the rear, and says to Capt. Johnson:
“Captain, I hear one of your company has just joined you after escaping
from the enemy.” Capt. Johnson said, “Yes, sir,” and pointed
to me as a Sergeant in his company. General Kilpatrick told me to
follow him and started ahead at a break neck pace. Inasmuch as the
highway was filled with troops, Gen. Kilpatrick and staff rode at the
side, through the fields, and any way they could get over the ground.
The horse I was on is a pacer and a very hard riding animal and it
was all I could do to hang on. Horse would jump over logs and
come down an all fours ker-chug, and I kept hoping the general
would stop pretty soon; but he didn’t. Having no saddle or anything
to guide the brute, it was a terrible hard ride for me, and time
and again if I had thought I could fall off without breaking my neck
should have done so. The soldiers all along the line laughed and
hooted at the spectacle and the staff had great sport, which was anything
but sport for me. After a while and after riding five or six
miles, Kilpatrick drew up in a grove by the side of the road and motioning
me to him, asked me when I escaped, etc. Soon saw I was
too tired and out of breath. After resting a few minutes I proceeded
to tell him what I knew of Savannah, the line of forts around the
city, and of other fortifications between us and the city, the location
of the rivers, force of rebels, etc. Asked a great many questions
and took down notes, or rather the chief of staff, Estes by name, did.
After an extended conversation a dispatch was made up and sent to
Gen. Sherman who was a few miles away, with the endorsement that
an escaped prisoner had given the information and it was reliable.
General Kilpatrick told me I would probably not be called upon to
do any more duty as I had done good service as a prisoner of war.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
Said he would sign a furlough and recommend that I go home as
soon as communication was opened. Thanked me for information
and dismissed me with congratulations on my escape. Then I waited
until our company, “A,” came up and joined them, and here I am
encamped with the boys, who are engaged in getting supper. We
are only twelve or fourteen miles from Savannah and the report in
camp is to the effect that the city has been evacuated with no fight
at all. Fort McAllister was taken to-day, which being the key to
Savannah, leaves that city unprotected, hence the evacuation. Communication
will now be opened with the gunboats on the coast and I
will be sent home to Michigan. I mess with Capt. Johnson and there
is peace and plenty among us. I go around from mess to mess this
pleasant night talking with the boys, learning and telling the news.
O. B. Driscoll, Al. Williams, Sergt. Smith, Mell Strickland, Sergt.
Fletcher, Teddy Fox, Lieut. Ingraham and all the rest think of something
new every few minutes, and I am full. Poor Robt. Strickland,
a boy whom I enlisted, was shot since starting out on this march to
the sea. Others too, whom I left well are now no more. The boys
have had a long and tedious march, yet are all in good health and
have enjoyed the trip. They never tire of telling about their fights
and skirmishes, and anecdotes concerning Kilpatrick, who is well
liked by all the soldiers. Am invited to eat with every mess in the
company, also at regimental head-quarters, in fact, anywhere I am a
mind to, can fill. And now this Diary is finished and is full. Shall
not write any more, though I hardly know how I shall get along,
without a self-imposed task of some kind.</p>

<p>A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT BECAME OF THE BOYS—REFUSED
PERMISSION TO GO HOME—A REFERENCE TO CAPT. WIRTZ—RETURN
HOME AT THE END OF THE WAR.</p>
</div>


<p>It may interest some one to know more of many who have been
mentioned at different times in this book, and I will proceed to enlighten
them.</p>

<p>George W. Hendryx came to the regiment in March, 1865, when
we were near Goldsboro, N. C. He says that after running away
from Andersonville at the time of the discovery of a break in which
all intended to get away in the summer of 1864, he traveled over one
hundred and fifty miles and was finally retaken by bushwhackers.
He represented himself as an officer of the 17th Michigan Infantry,
escaped from Columbia, S. C., and was sent to that place and put
with officers in the prison there, changing his name so as not to be
found out as having escaped from Andersonville. In due time he
was exchanged with a batch of other officers and went home North.
After a short time he joined his regiment and company for duty. He
was both delighted and surprised to see me, as he supposed of course
I had died in Andersonville, it having been so reported to him at the
North. He did valiant service until the war was over, which soon
happened. He went home with the regiment and was mustered out
of service, since when I have never seen or heard of him for a certainty.
Think that he went to California.</p>

<p>Sergt. Wm. B. Rowe was exchanged in March, 1865, but never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
joined the regiment. His health was ruined to a certain extent from
his long confinement. Is still alive, however, and resides at Dansville,
Mich.</p>

<p>Sergt. Bullock was also exchanged at the same time, but never did
service thereafter. He is now an inmate of a Michigan insane asylum,
and has been for some years, whether from the effects of prison
life I know not, but should presume it is due to his sufferings there.
His was a particularly sad case. He was taken sick in the early days
of Andersonville and was sick all the time while in that place, a
mere walking and talking skeleton. There is no doubt in my mind
that his insanity resulted from his long imprisonment.</p>

<p>E. P. Sanders arrived home in Michigan in April, 1865, and made
me a visit at Jackson that Summer. He was the only one of all my
comrades in prison that I came in contact with, who fully regained
health, or apparently was in good health. He was a particularly
strong and healthy man, and is now engaged in farming near Lansing,
Michigan.</p>

<p>Lieut. Wm. H. Robinson, who was removed from Belle Isle, from
our mess, it having been discovered that he was an officer instead of
an orderly sergeant, was exchanged early in 1864, from Richmond,
and immediately joined his regiment, doing duty all the time thereafter.
Soon after my escape and while with company “A,” a note
was handed me from Capt. Robinson, my old friend, he having been
promoted to a captaincy. The note informed me that he was only a
few miles away, and asked me to come and see him that day. You
may rest assured I was soon on the road, and that day had the pleasure
of taking my dinner with him. He was on his general’s staff,
and I dined at head-quarters, much to my discomfiture, not being
up with such distinguished company. We had a good visit, I remember,
and I went to camp at night well satisfied with my ride.
Told me that a pipe which I engraved and presented to him on Belle
Isle was still in his possession, and always should be. Was a favorite
with every one, and a fine looking officer. He is now a resident
of Sterling, Whiteside Co., Ill. Is a banker, hardware dealer, one
of the City Fathers, and withal a prominent citizen. It was lucky he
was an officer and taken away from us on Belle Isle, for he would
undoubtedly have died at Andersonville, being of rather a delicate
frame and constitution.</p>

<p>My good old friend Battese, I regret to say, I have never seen or
heard of since he last visited me in the Marine Hospital at Savannah.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
Have written many letters and made many inquiries, but to no effect.
He was so reticent while with us in the prison, that we did not
learn enough of him to make inquiries since then effective. Although
for many months I was in his immediate presence, he said nothing of
where he lived, his circumstances, or anything else. I only know
that his name was Battese, that he belonged to a Minnesota regiment
and was a noble fellow. I don’t know of a man in the world I would
rather see to-day than him, and I hope some day when I have got
rich out of this book (if that time should ever come,) to go to Minnesota
and look him up. There are many Andersonville survivors
who must remember the tall Indian, and certainly I shall, as long as
life shall last.</p>

<p>Michael Hoare tells his own story farther along, in answer to a letter
written him for information regarding his escape from the Savannah
hospital. Mike, at the close of the war re-enlisted in the
regular army and went to the extreme west to fight Indians, and
when his term of service expired again re-enlisted and remained in
the service. In 1878 he was discharged on account of disability, and
is now an inmate of the Disabled Soldier’s Home, at Dayton, Ohio.
From his letters to me he seems the same jolly, good natured hero
as of old. I hope to see him before many months, for the first time
since he shook me by the hand and passed in and out of his tunnel
from the Marine Hospital and to freedom.</p>

<p>The two cousins Buck, David and Eli S., I last saw top of some
corn in an army wagon I jumped from when I first encountered the
9th Mich. Cavalry. Little thought that would be the last time I
should see them. Their command belonged to the Eastern Army in
the region of the Potomac, and when communication was opened at
Savannah they were sent there on transports. I afterward received
letters from both of them, and David’s picture; also his wife’s whom
he had just married. David’s picture is reproduced in this book and
I must say hardly does him justice as he was a good looking and active
fellow. Presume Eli is a farmer if alive, and “Dave” probably
preaching.</p>

<p>“Limber Jim,” who was instrumental in putting down the raiders
at Andersonville, was until recently a resident of Joliet, Illinois. He
died last winter, in 1880, and it is said his health was always poor
after his terrible summer of 1864. He was a hero in every sense of
the word, and if our government did not amply repay him for valiant
service done while a prisoner of war, then it is at fault.</p>

<p>Sergt. Winn of the 100th Ohio, who befriended me at Savannah,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
is, I think, a citizen of Cincinnati, Ohio, and a prosperous man.
Any way, he was in 1870 or thereabouts. Was an upright man and
good fellow.</p>

<p>Every one knows the fate of Capt. Wirtz, our prison commander
at Andersonville, who was hung at Washington, D. C., in 1866, for
his treatment of us Union prisoners of war. It was a righteous judgment,
still I think there are others who deserved hanging fully as
much. He was but the willing tool of those higher in command.
Those who put him there knew his brutal disposition, and should
have suffered the same disposition made of him. Although, I believe
at this late day those who were in command and authority over Capt.
Wirtz have successfully thrown the blame on his shoulders, it does
not excuse them in the least so far as I am concerned. They are just
as much to blame that thirteen thousand men died in a few months
at that worst place the world has ever seen, as Capt. Wirtz, and
should have suffered accordingly. I don’t blame any of them for
being rebels if they thought it right, but I do their inhuman treatment
of prisoners of war.</p>

<p>Hub Dakin is now a resident of Dansville, Mich., the same village
in which lives Wm. B. Rowe. He has been more or less disabled
since the war, and I believe is now trying to get a pension from the
government for disability contracted while in prison. It is very difficult
for ex-prisoners of war to get pensions, owing to the almost
impossibility of getting sufficient evidence. The existing pension
laws require that an officer of the service shall have knowledge of the
origin of disease, or else two comrades who may be enlisted men.
At this late day it is impossible to remember with accuracy sufficient
to come up to the requirements of the law. There is no doubt that
all were more or less disabled, and the mere fact of their having
spent the summer in Andersonville, should be evidence enough to
procure assistance from the government.</p>

<p>And now a closing chapter in regard to myself. As soon as Savannah
was occupied by our troops and communications opened with the
North, a furlough was made out by Capt. Johnson, of our company,
and signed by Assistant Surgeon Young, and then by Col. Acker. I
then took the furlough to Gen. Kilpatrick, which he signed, and also
endorsed on the back to the effect that he hoped Gen. Sherman
would also sign and send me North. From Gen. Kilpatrick’s head-quarters
I went to see Gen. Sherman at Savannah and was ushered
into his presence. The Gen. looked the paper over and then said no
men were being sent home now and no furloughs granted for any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
cause. If I was permanently disabled I could be sent to Northern
hospitals, or if I had been an exchanged prisoner of war, could be
sent North, but there was no provision made for escaped prisoners
of war. Encouraged me with the hope, however, that the war was
nearly over and it could not be long before we would all go home.
Gave me a paper releasing me from all duty until such time as I saw
fit to do duty, and said the first furlough granted should be mine,
and he would retain it and send to me as soon as possible. Cannot
say that I was very sadly disappointed, as I was having a good time
with the company, and regaining my health and getting better
every day, with the exception of my leg, which still troubled me.
Stayed with the company until Lee surrendered, Lincoln assassinated
and all the fighting over and then leaving Chapel Hill,
North Carolina, in April, went to my home in Michigan. In a few
weeks was followed by the regiment, when we were all mustered out
of the service. As had been reported to me at the regiment, I had
been regarded as dead, and funeral sermon preached.</p>

<p>It was my sad duty to call upon the relatives of quite a number
who died in Andersonville, among whom were those of Dr. Lewis,
John McGuire and Jimmy Devers. The relics which had been entrusted
to my keeping were all lost with two exceptions, and through
no fault of mine. At the time of my severe sickness when first taken
to Savannah, and when I was helpless as a child, the things drifted
away from me some way, and were lost. But for the fact that
Battese had two of my diary books and Sergt. Winn the other, they
also would have been lost.</p>

<p>I hope that this Diary may prove successful in its mission of truly
portraying the scenes at Andersonville and elsewhere during the time
of my imprisonment, and if so, the object of its author shall have
been accomplished.</p>

<p class="noindent"><em>Comrade John L. Ransom</em>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>:— * * * * The night I left the stockade, going
within twelve feet of a guard, I went down to the city. Had
never been there before and did not know where to go, but wandered
about the streets, dressed in an old suit of rebel clothes, until 12
o’clock that night. It was Oct. 18th, 1864, and I had been captured
March 5th, in Col. Dahlgreen’s raid, the object of which was to release
the officers confined in Libby prison and the privates confined
on Belle Island and Pemberton prisons. * * * * My
whole uniform was disposed of * * * and I had to wear dirty
rebel rags. They marched us to Stevensville. We remained there
but a short time when we were marched about two miles and
into the heart of a swamp. We did not know what the matter was
but found out that Kilpatrick had turned back to look for us, the
“forlorn hope,” as we were called. If he had been one hour sooner,
he would have released us; but fate would have it the other way.
From the swamp we were marched to Richmond, surrounded by the
mounted mob. They would not let us step out of the ranks even to
quench our thirst, and we had to drink the muddy water from the
middle of the road. Every little town we came to the rebels would
assemble and yell at us, the women the worst. * * * *
When we reached the head-quarters of rebeldom the whole rebel city
was out to meet us * * * * and the self-styled rebel ladies were
the worst in their vim and foul language. They made a rush for us,
but the guard kept them off until we were safely put in the third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
story of the Pemberton building, where we were searched and stripped
of everything we were not already robbed of. * * * *
The next morning the Richmond people cried out for Jeff Davis to
hang us, saying we were nothing but outlaws and robbers, on an errand
of plunder and rapine. The press tried to excite hostility
against us, and succeeded, in a measure. We were kept by ourselves
and not allowed to mix with the other prisoners. A special guard
was kept over us, and we were allowed but two-thirds the small rations
issued to the other men. The windows were all out of the room
we were in, and a cold March wind blowing and cutting through our
starving, naked bodies. * * * * In July we were
going to get hanged in Castle Thunder. We were told the same story
every day, and it was getting stale, so we paid no attention to it; but
sure enough, we were called out one morning and thought our
time had come. They marched us up Casey street toward Castle
Thunder, and as we approached it some fairly shivered at their promised
doom; but instead of stopping at that celebrated hotel, we were
taken across the river and put in cattle cars. Where we were going
none knew; but we started and the next day reached Dansville. We
were removed from the cars and put into a tobacco warehouse and
were kept there until the next morning, when we were put aboard
the cars and started south again until we came to the world renowned
hell-hole, Andersonville. When we arrived several men were dead
in the cars, and the rebels would not let us remove them. The cars
were packed like herring boxes, so you may imagine our situation.
* * * * From there I was transferred to Savannah, and from
the latter place I made my escape, as previously mentioned.</p>

<p>As I have said, I wandered about until 12 o’clock, and was then in
a worn out condition. Not knowing where to turn or lay my head, I
sat down under a tree to rest myself, and as I sat there, who should
come along but a watchman. “Hello!” says he, “what are you doing
here at this hour of the night?” I answered that I was one of the
guards guarding the Yankees at the stockade, and that I had been
down to Bryan street to see my sister. “All right,” said he, “You
fellows have a hard time guarding them d—d Yankees. Why don’t
you shoot more of ’em and get ’em out o’ the way?” I passed on until
I came to a place with a high board fence. I crawled over and
looked around and found a small shed divided by a board partition.
In one end they kept a cow and in the other some fodder. I went in
where the fodder was and threw myself down and went to sleep, intending
to be up before day; but what was my surprise when it proved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
to be broad daylight before I awoke. I lay there thinking what
to do, when I heard the gate of the fence open. I jumped up and
looked through a crack in the boards and saw an old man enter with
a pail in his hand. Presently he came where I was in the fodder to
get some for the cow. As he opened the door he started back with
fright, saying, “Who are you and what brings you here?” I saw by
his face and voice that he was an Irishman, and I made up my mind
to tell him the truth. * * * He told me to remain where I was
and he would try and get me something to eat. He went away and
presently returned with a tin pan full of sweet potatoes and bacon.
* * * * He told me the only way to get away was by the Isle of
Hope, ten miles from the city on the Skidaway shell road. There
was a picket post of twelve men right on the road, but I started off,
and when I reached the picket put on a bold face and told them I
belonged to Maxwell’s battery, stationed at the Isle of Hope, and they
let me pass. * * * I passed officers and soldiers on the road, but
they never took any notice of me further than to return my kindly
greeting. I finally reached the outpost on the road, about a mile
from freedom. I had known, even before starting, that to pass that
post I should have to have a pass signed by the commanding officer
at Savannah; but there were swamps on both sides the road, and I
thought I could swim in the marsh and flank the post. I took off
my jacket and made the attempt, but had to return to the road.
* * * * I saw there was no use trying to escape by the Isle of
Hope. I could not pass the outpost, and besides, there was great
danger that I should be hung as a spy. So I put back to Savannah
that night. I had to wade the marsh to get by the post I first passed.
I got safely back to my cowshed and laid there till woke up the next
morning by my friend Gleason. When I told him where I had been
he would hardly believe me. * * * * He brought me something
to eat and went away, but returned at night with two other men.
Their names were Wall and Skelley and they belonged to the 3d
Georgia artillery. They said they were northern men, but were in
Savannah when the war broke out and had to join the rebel army.
I told them the history of my adventure by the Isle of Hope and they
were astonished. They said the only way was by the river to Fort
Pulaski, fourteen miles from Savannah. The question was, where
to get a boat. They were known in Savannah and their movements
would be watched. They said they knew where there was a boat,
but it was a government boat. I said that made it better, and if they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
would show me where the boat was, I would do the headwork. So
they showed me and left me the management. I went when everything
was ready, and muffled the oars and oarlocks, with a sentinel
within twenty feet of me. The boat lay in the river, near the gas-house
and a government store-house, and the river was guarded by
gunboats and the floating battery, and paved with torpedoes; but
there is what is called “the back river,” which flows into the Savannah
above Smith Island. The mouth of this stream was guarded by
a picket crew, sent from the battery every night; so when we left we
had to lay in a rice sluice, where we ran the boat in about an eighth
of a mile, and raised the grass as the boat passed along to conceal
our tracks. We heard them searching the next morning, after the
boat had been missed, but the search was at last given up. About
this time Skelley began talking about being recaptured, as the shore
was picketed all the way. He said there would be nothing done with
me, if I was recaptured but to put me back in the stockade, while he
and Wall would be shot as deserters. He proposed returning to Savannah
at once. * * * * He began to win the other fellow over
and I saw the game was up with me. Skelley was the only one of us
who was armed and he had a Colt’s revolver. * * * * I told
him that his plan was the best and that I didn’t want to be the means
of getting him into trouble. I gained his confidence, but the thought
of returning to Savannah never entered my head. I watched my
chance, and at a favorable opportunity, snatched his pistol. * * *
I rose to my feet with the pistol at full cock, pointed it at his breast
and told him that one move towards returning to Savannah would end
his career by a bullet from his own revolver. He turned all colors,
but said nothing. I kept my distance, and at four o’clock in the afternoon
told them to get into the boat. I then sat down in the stern
and told them to pull out, which they did with a vim. Just as we
passed the mouth, we heard the click of oars on the picket boat; but
they were too late, and all the danger we had to encounter was the
pickets on the shore which we had to hug on account of torpedoes
in the channel. I don’t know how we ever passed safely over the
torpedoes and by the pickets, which latter were within forty yards of
us all the way along until we reached Pulaski. All that saved us was
that the pickets had fires lighted and were looking at them, and our
oars and oarlocks being muffled, they did not hear or see us. It was
very dark when we struck the mouth of the Savannah, and whereabouts
Fort Pulaski lay we knew not; but we kept pulling until halted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
by a soldier of the 144th N. Y. Infantry, who was guarding the
place at that time. We were ordered to pull in, which we did, and
were taken up to the commanding officer and questioned. He said
it was the most daring escape ever made, up to that time, considering
the obstacles we had to encounter. We were kept in the guard
house until my statement was confirmed by the war department,
when I was released and sent to Washington, where I reported to the
Adjutant-General who gave me a furlough and sent me to the hospital.
I remained there until spring, when I rejoined my regiment and
was mustered out at the close of the war. * * * * *</p>

<p>We cannot do better than copy into this book a very complete
description of Andersonville Prison, by Joseph Jones, Surgeon P. A.
C. S., Professor of Medical Chemistry in the Medical College of
Georgia, at Augusta, Ga., as given at the Wirtz trial at Washington,
D. C., he being a witness for the prosecution:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“Hearing of the unusual mortality among the prisoners confined
at Andersonville, in the month of August, 1864, during a visit to
Richmond, I expressed to the Surgeon General, S. P. Moore, Confederate
States of America, a desire to visit Camp Sumpter, with the
design of instituting a series of inquiries upon the nature and causes
of the prevailing diseases. Small-pox had appeared among the prisoners,
and I believed that this would prove an admirable field for the
study of its characteristic lesions. The condition of Peyer’s glands
in this disease was considered as worthy a minute investigation. It
was believed that a large portion of the men from the Northern portion
of the United States, suddenly transported to a Southern climate,
and confined upon a small portion of land, would furnish an
excellent field for the investigation of the relations of typhus, typhoid,
and malarial fevers.</p>

<p>The Surgeon General of the Confederate States of America furnished
me with letters of introduction to the surgeon in charge of
the Confederate States Military prison at Andersonville, Ga., and
the following is my description of that place:</p>

<p>The Confederate Military Prison at Andersonville, Ga., consists of
a strong stockade, twenty feet in height, enclosing twenty-seven
acres. The stockade is formed of strong pine logs, firmly planted in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
the ground. The main stockade is surrounded by two other similar
rows of pine logs, the middle stockade being sixteen feet high, and
the outer one twelve feet. These are intended for offense and
defense. If the inner stockade should at any time be forced by the
prisoners, the second forms another line of defense; while in case of
an attempt to deliver the prisoners by a force operating upon the exterior,
the outer line forms an admirable protection to the Confederate
troops, and a most formidable obstacle to cavalry or infantry.
The four angles of the outer line are strengthened by earthworks
upon commanding eminences, from which the cannon, in case of an
outbreak among the prisoners, may sweep the entire enclosure; and
it was designed to connect these works by a line of rifle pits running
zig-zag around the outer stockade; those rifle pits have never been
completed. The ground enclosed by the innermost stockade lies in
the form of a parallelogram, the larger diameter running almost due
north and south. This space includes the northern and southern opposing
sides of two hills, between which a stream of water runs from
west to east. The surface soil of these two hills is composed chiefly
of sand with varying mixtures of clay and oxide of iron. The clay
is sufficiently tenacious to give a considerable degree of consistency
to the soil. The internal structure of the hills, as revealed by the
deep wells, is similar to that already described. The alternate layers
of clay and sand, as well as the oxide of iron, which forms in its
various combinations a cement to the sand, allows of extensive tunneling.
The prisoners not only constructed numerous dirt houses
with balls of clay and sand, taken from the wells which they had
excavated all over these hills, but they have also, in some cases, tunneled
extensively from these wells. The lower portion of these hills,
bordering on the stream, are wet and boggy from the constant oozing
of water. The stockade was built originally to accommodate
ten thousand prisoners, and included at first seventeen acres. Near
the close of the month of June the area was enlarged by the addition
of ten acres. The ground added was situated on the northern slope
of the largest hill.</p>

<p>Within the circumscribed area of the stockade the Federal prisoners
were compelled to perform all the functions of life, cooking, washing,
the calls of nature, exercise, and sleeping. During the month of
March the prison was less crowded than at any subsequent time, and
then the average space of ground to each prisoner was only 98.7 feet or
less than eleven square yards. The Federal prisoners were gathered
from all parts of the Confederate States east of the Mississippi, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
crowded into the confined space, until, in the month of June the
average number of square feet of ground to each prisoner was only
32.3 or less than four square yards. These figures represent the
stockade in a better light even than it really was; for a considerable
breadth of land along the stream flowing from west to east between
the hills was low and boggy, and was covered with the excrements of
the men and thus rendered wholly uninhabitable, and in fact useless
for every purpose except that of defaction. The pines and other
small trees and shrubs, which originally were scattered sparsely over
these hills were in a short time cut down by the prisoners for firewood,
and no shade tree was left in the entire enclosure of the stockade.
With their characteristic industry and ingenuity, the Federals
constructed for themselves small huts and caves, and attempted to
shield themselves from the rain and sun, and night damps and dew.
But few tents were distributed to the prisoners, and those were in
most cases torn and rotten. In the location and arrangement of these
huts no order appears to have been followed; in fact, regular streets
appear to be out of the question on so crowded an area; especially,
too, as large bodies of prisoners were from time to time added suddenly
and without any preparations. The irregular arrangement of
the huts and imperfect shelters was very unfavorable for the maintenance
of a proper system of police.</p>

<p>The police and internal economy of the prison was left almost
entirely in the hands of the prisoners themselves; the duties of the
Confederate soldiers acting as guards being limited to the occupation
of the boxes or lookouts ranged around the stockade at regular intervals,
and to the manning of the batteries at the angles of the prison.
Even judicial matters pertaining to the prisoners themselves, as the
detection and punishment of such crimes as theft and murder appear
to have been in a great measure abandoned to the prisoners.</p>

<p>The large number of men confined within the stockade soon, under
a defective system of police, and with imperfect arrangements, covered
the surface of the low ground with excrements. The sinks
over the lower portions of the stream were imperfect in their plan
and structure, and the excrements were in large measure deposited
so near the borders of the stream as not to be washed away, or else
accumulated upon the low boggy ground. The volume of water was
not sufficient to wash away the feces, and they accumulated in such
quantities as to form a mass of liquid excrement. Heavy rains
caused the water of the stream to rise and as the arrangements for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
the passage of the increased amount of water out of the stockade
were insufficient, the liquid feces overflowed the low grounds and
covered them several inches after the subsidence of the waters. The
action of the sun upon this putrefying mass of excrements and fragments
of bread and meat and bones excited most rapid fermentation
and developed a horrible stench. Improvements were projected for
the removal of the filth and for the prevention of its accumulation,
but they were only partially and imperfectly carried out. As the
forces of the prisoners were reduced by confinement, want of exercise,
improper diet, and by scurvy, diarrhea, and dysentary, they
were unable to evacuate their bowels within the stream or along its
banks; and the excrements were deposited at the very doors of their
tents. The vast majority appeared to lose all repulsion of filth, and
both sick and well disregarded all the laws of hygiene and personal
cleanliness. The accommodations for the sick were imperfect and
insufficient. From the organization of the prison, February 24, 1864,
to May 22, the sick were treated within the stockade. In the crowded
condition of the stockade, and with the tents and huts clustered
thickly around the hospital, it was impossible to secure proper ventilation
or to maintain the necessary police. The Federal prisoners
also made frequent forays upon the hospital stores and carried off
the food and clothing of the sick. The hospital was, on the 22d of
May, removed to its present site without the stockade, and five acres
of ground covered with oaks and pines appropriated to the use of
the sick.</p>

<p>The supply of medical officers has been insufficient from the foundation
of the prison.</p>

<p>The nurses and attendants upon the sick have been most generally
Federal prisoners, who in too many cases appear to have been devoid
of moral principle, and who not only neglected their duties, but were
also engaged in extensive robberies of the sick.</p>

<p>From want of proper police and hygienic regulations alone it is
not wonderful that from February 24 to September 21, 1864, nine
thousand four hundred and seventy-nine deaths, nearly one-third the
entire number of prisoners have been recorded.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit to Andersonville a large number of Federal
prisoners had been removed to Millen, Savannah, Charleston, and
other parts of the Confederacy, in anticipation of an advance of
General Sherman’s forces from Atlanta, with the design of liberating
their captive bretheren; however, about fifteen thousand prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
remained confined within the limits of the stockade and prison hospital.</p>

<p>In the stockade, with the exception of the damp lowlands bordering
the small stream, the surface was covered with huts, and small
ragged tents and parts of blankets and fragments of oil-cloth, coats,
and blankets stretched upon sticks. The tents and huts were not arranged
according to any order, and there was in most parts of the
enclosure scarcely room for two men to walk abreast between the
tents and huts.</p>

<p>If one might judge from the large pieces of corn bread scattered
about in every direction on the ground the prisoners were either very
lavishly supplied with this article of diet, or else this kind of food
was not relished by them.</p>

<p>Each day the dead from the stockade were carried out by their
fellow prisoners and deposited upon the ground under a bush arbor,
just outside of the southwestern gate. From thence they were carried
on carts to the burying ground, one-quarter of a mile northwest
of the prison. The dead were buried without coffins, side by side, in
trenches four feet deep.</p>

<p>The low grounds bordering the stream were covered with human
excrements and filth of all kinds, which in many places seemed to be
alive with working maggots. An indescribable sickening stench
arose from these fermenting masses of human filth.</p>

<p>There were near five thousand seriously ill Federals in the stockade
and the Confederate States Military Prison Hospital, and the
deaths exceeded one hundred per day, and large numbers of the prisoners
who were walking about, and who had not been entered upon
the sick reports, were suffering incurable diarrhea, dysentery, and
scurvy. The sick were attended almost entirely by their fellow
prisoners, appointed as nurses, and as they received but little attention,
they were compelled to exert themselves at all times to attend
the calls of nature, and hence they retain the power of moving about
to within a comparatively short period of the close of life. Owing
to the slow progress of the diseases most prevalent, diarrhea and
chronic dysentery, the corpses were as a general rule emaciated.</p>

<p>I visited two thousand sick within the stockade, laying under
some long sheds which had been built at the northern portion for
themselves. At this time only one medical officer was in attendance,
whereas at least twenty medical officers should have been employed.</p>

<p>Scurvy, diarrhea, dysentary, and hospital gangrene were the prevailing
diseases. I was surprised to find but few cases of malarial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
fever, and no well-marked cases either of typhus or typhoid fever.
The absence of the different forms of malarial fever may be accounted
for in the supposition that the artificial atmosphere of the stockade,
crowded densely with human beings and loaded with animal exhalations,
was unfavorable to the existence and action of the malarial
poison. The absence of typhoid and typhus fevers amongst all the
causes which are known to generate these diseases, appeared to be
due to the fact that the great majority of these prisoners had been in
captivity in Virginia, at Belle Isle, and in other parts of the Confederacy
for months, and even as long as two years, and during this
time they had been subjected to the same bad influences, and those
who had not had these fevers before either had them during their
confinement in Confederate prisons or else their systems, from long
exposure, were proof against their action.</p>

<p>The effects of scurvy were manifest on every hand, and in all its
various stages, from the muddy pale complexion, pale gums, feeble,
languid muscular motions, lowness of spirits, and fetid breath, to the
dusky, dirty, leaden complexion, swollen features, spongy, purple,
livid, fungoid, bleeding gums, loose teeth, œdematous limbs, covered
with livid vibices, and petechiæ spasmodically flexed, painful and
hardened extremities, spontaneous hemorrhages from mucous canals,
and large, ill-conditioned, spreading ulcers covered with a dark purplish
fungus growth. I observed that in some of the cases of scurvy
the parotid glands were greatly swollen, and in some instances to
such an extent as to preclude entirely the power to articulate. In
several cases of dropsy the abdomen and lower extremities supervening
upon scurvy, the patients affirmed that previously to the appearance
of the dropsy they had suffered with profuse and obstinate
diarrhea, and that when this was checked by a change of diet, from
Indian corn-bread baked with the husk, to boiled rice, the dropsy
disappeared. The severe pains and livid patches were frequently
associated with swellings in various parts, and especially in the lower
extremities, accompanied with stiffness and contractions of the knee
joints and ankles, and often with a brawny feel of those parts, as if
lymph had been effused between the integuments and apeneuroses,
preventing the motion of the skin over the swollen parts. Many of
the prisoners believed that scurvy was contagious, and I saw men
guarding their wells and springs, fearing lest some man suffering
with scurvy might use the water and thus poison them. I observed
also numerous cases of hospital gangrene, and of spreading scorbutic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
ulcers, which had supervened upon slight injuries. The scorbutic
ulcers presented a dark, purple fungoid, elevated surface, with livid
swollen edges, and exuded a thin, fetid, sanious fluid, instead of pus.
Many ulcers which originated from the scorbutic condition of the
system appeared to become truly gangrenous, assuming all the characteristics
of hospital gangrene. From the crowded condition, filthy
habits, bad diet, and dejected, depressed condition of the prisoners,
their systems had become so disordered that the smallest abration of
the skin, from the rubbing of a shoe, or from the effects of the sun,
or from the prick of a splinter, or from scratching, or a musquito
bite, in some cases, took on a rapid and frightful ulceration and gangrene.
The long use of salt meat, oft-times imperfectly cured, as
well as the most total deprivation of vegetables and fruit, appeared
to be the chief causes of the scurvy. I carefully examined the
bakery and the bread furnished the prisoners, and found that they
were supplied almost entirely with corn-bread from which the husk
had not been separated. This husk acted as an irritant to the
alimentary canal, without adding any nutriment to the bran. As
far as my examination extended no fault could be found with the
mode in which the bread was baked; the difficulty lay in the failure
to separate the husk from the corn-meal. I strongly urged the
preparation of large quantities of soup from the cow and calves’
heads, with the brains and tongues, to which a liberal supply of
sweet potatoes and vegetables might have been advantageously
added. The material existed in abundance for the preparation of
such soup in large quantities with but little additional expense.
Such aliment would have been not only highly nutricious, but it
would also have acted as an efficient remedial agent for the removal
of the scorbutic condition. The sick within the stockade lay under
several long sheds which were originally built for barracks. These
sheds covered two floors which were open on all sides. The sick lay
upon the bare boards, or upon such ragged blankets as they possessed,
without, as far as I observed, any bedding or even straw.</p>

<p>The haggard, distressed countenances of these miserable, complaining,
dejected, living skeletons, crying for medical aid and food, and
cursing their government for its refusal to exchange prisoners, and
the ghastly corpses, with their glazed eye balls staring up into vacant
space, with the flies swarming down their open and grinning mouths
and over their ragged clothes, infested with lice, as they lay amongst
the sick and dying, formed a picture of helpless, hopeless misery
which it would be impossible to portray by words or by the brush.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
A feeling of disappointment and even resentment on account of the
United States Government upon the subject of the exchange of prisoners,
appeared to be widespread, and the apparent hopeless nature
of the negotiations for some general exchange of prisoners appeared
to be a cause of universal regret and injurious despondency. I heard
some of the prisoners go so far as to exonerate the Confederate Government
from any charge of intentionally subjecting them to a
protracted confinement, with its necessary and unavoidable sufferings,
in a country cut off from all intercourse with foreign nations,
and sorely pressed on all sides, whilst on the other hand they charged
their prolonged captivity upon their own government, which was
attempting to make the negro equal to the white man. Some hundred
or more of the prisoners had been released from confinement
in the stockade on parole, and filled various offices as druggists,
clerks, carpenters, etc., in the various departments. These men were
well clothed, and presented a stout and healthy appearance, and as
a general rule they presented a more robust and healthy appearance
than the Confederate troops guarding the prisoners.</p>

<p>The entire grounds are surrounded by a frail board fence, and are
strictly guarded by Confederate soldiers, and no prisoner except the
paroled attendants is allowed to leave the grounds except by a special
permit from the commandant of the interior of the prison.</p>

<p>The patients and attendants, near two thousand in number, are
crowded into this confined space and are but poorly supplied with
old and ragged tents. Large numbers of them were without any
bunks in their tents, and lay upon the ground, oft-times without
even a blanket. No beds or straw appeared to have been furnished.
The tents extend to within a few yards of the small stream, the eastern
portion of which, as we have before said, is used as a privy and
is loaded with excrements; and I observed a large pile of corn-bread,
bones, and filth of all kinds, thirty feet in diameter and several feet
high, swarming with myriads of flies, in a vacant space near the pots
used for cooking. Millions of flies swarmed over everything, and
covered the faces of the sleeping patients, and crawled down their
open mouths, and deposited their maggots in the gangrenous wounds
of the living, and in the mouths of the dead. Musquetos in great
numbers also infest the tents, and many of the patients were so stung
by these pestiferous insects, that they resembled those suffering from
a slight attack of the measles.</p>

<p>The police hygiene of the hospital were defective in the extreme;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
the attendants, who appeared in almost every instance to have been
selected from the prisoners, seemed to have in many cases but little
interest in the welfare of their fellow-captives. The accusation was
made that the nurses in many cases robbed the sick of their clothing,
money, and rations, and carried on a clandestine trade with the
paroled prisoners and Confederate guards without the hospital enclosure,
in the clothing, effects of the sick, dying, and dead Federals.
They certainly appeared to neglect the comfort and cleanliness of the
sick entrusted to their care in a most shameful manner, even after
making due allowances for the difficulties of the situation. Many of
the sick were literally encrusted with dirt and filth and covered with
vermin. When a gangrenous wound needed washing, the limb was
thrust out a little from the blanket, or board, or rags upon which
the patient was lying, and water poured over it, and all the putrescent
matter allowed to soak into the ground floor of the tent. The
supply of rags for dressing wounds was said to be very scant, and I
saw the most filthy rags which had been applied several times and
imperfectly washed, used in dressing wounds. Where hospital gangrene
was prevailing, it was impossible for any wound to escape
contagion under these circumstances. The results of the treatment
of wounds in the hospital were of the most unsatisfactory character,
from this neglect of cleanliness, in the dressings and wounds themselves,
as well as from various other causes which will be more fully
considered. I saw several gangrenous wounds filled with maggots.
I have frequently seen neglected wounds amongst the Confederate
soldiers similarly affected; and as far as my experience extends,
these worms destroy only the dead tissues and do not injure specially
the well parts. I have even heard surgeons affirm that a gangrenous
wound which had been thoroughly cleansed by maggots, healed more
rapidly than if it had been left to itself. This want of cleanliness on
the part of the nurses appeared to be the result of carelessness and
inattention, rather than of malignant design, and the whole trouble
can be traced to the want of the proper police and sanitary regulations,
and to the absence of intelligent organization and division of
labor. The abuses were in a large measure due to the almost total
absence of system, government, and rigid, but wholesome sanitary
regulations. In extenuation of these abuses it was alleged by the
medical officers that the Confederate troops were barely sufficient to
guard the prisoners, and that it was impossible to obtain any number
of experienced nurses from the Confederate forces. In fact, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
guard appeared to be too small, even for the regulation of the internal
hygiene and police of the hospital.</p>

<p>The manner of disposing of the dead was also calculated to depress
the already desponding spirits of these men, many of whom have
been confined for months, and even for two years in Richmond and
other places, and whose strength had been wasted by bad air, bad
food, and neglect of personal cleanliness. The dead-house is merely
a frame covered with old tent cloth and a few bushes, situated in the
southwestern corner of the hospital grounds. When a patient dies,
he is simply laid in the narrow street in front of his tent, until he is
removed by Federal negroes detailed to carry off the dead; if a
patient dies during the night, he lies there until the morning, and
during the day even the dead were frequently allowed to remain for
hours in these walks. In the dead-house the corpses lie upon the
bare ground, and were in most cases covered with filth and vermin.</p>

<p>The cooking arrangements are of the most defective character.
Five large iron pots similar to those used for boiling sugar cane,
appeared to be the only cooking utensils furnished the hospital for
the cooking of two thousand men; and the patients were dependent
in a great measure upon their own miserable utensils. They were
allowed to cook in the tent doors and in the lanes, and this was
another source of filth, and another favorable condition for the generation
and multiplication of flies and other vermin.</p>

<p>The air of the tents was foul and disagreeable in the extreme, and
in fact the entire grounds emitted a most nauseous and disgusting
smell. I entered nearly all the tents and carefully examined the cases
of interest, and especially the cases of gangrene, upon numerous
occasions, during the prosecution of my pathological inquiries at
Andersonville, and therefore enjoyed every opportunity to judge correctly
of the hygiene and police of the hospital.</p>

<p>There appeared to be almost absolute indifference and neglect of
the part of the patient, of personal cleanliness; their persons and
clothing in most instances, and especially those suffering with gangrene
and scorbutic ulcers, were filthy in the extreme and covered
with vermin. It was too often the case that the patients were
received from the stockade in a most deplorable condition. I have
seen men brought in from the stockade in a dying condition, begrimmed
from head to foot with their own excrements, and so black from
smoke and filth that they resembled negroes rather than white men.
That this description of the stockade has not been overdrawn, will
appear from the reports of the surgeon in charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>We will first examine the consolidated report of the sick and wounded
Federal prisoners. During six months, from the 1st of March to
the 31st of August, forty-two thousand six hundred and eighty-six
cases of sickness and wounds were reported. No classified record of
the sick in the stockade was kept after the establishment of the hospital
without the prison. This fact, in conjunction with those
already presented relating to the insufficiency of medical officers and
the extreme illness and even death of many prisoners in the tents in
the stockade, without any medical attention or record beyond the
bare number of the dead, demonstrates that these figures, large as
they seem to be, are far below the truth.</p>

<p>As the number of prisoners varied greatly at different periods, the
relations between those reported sick and well, as far as those statistics
extend, can best be determined by a comparison of the statistics
of each month.</p>

<p>During this period of six months no less than five hundred and
sixty-five deaths are recorded under the head of morbi vanie. In
other words, those men died without having received sufficient medical
attention for the determination of even the name of the disease
causing death.</p>

<p>During the month of August fifty-three cases and fifty-three deaths
are recorded as due to marasmus. Surely this large number of deaths
must have been due to some other morbid state than slow wasting.
If they were due to improper and insufficient food, they should have
been classed accordingly, and if to diarrhea or dysentary or scurvy,
the classification in like manner should have been explicit.</p>

<p>We observe a progressive increase of the rate of mortality, from
3.11 per cent. in March to 9.09 per cent. of mean strength, sick and
well, in August. The ratio of mortality continued to increase during
September, for notwithstanding the removal of one-half the
entire number of prisoners during the early portion of the month,
one thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven (1,767) deaths are registered
from September 1 to 21, and the largest number of deaths
upon any one day occurred during this month, on the 16th, viz: one
hundred and nineteen.</p>

<p>The entire number of Federal prisoners confined at Andersonville
was about forty thousand six hundred and eleven; and during the
period of near seven months, from February 24 to September 21,
nine thousand four hundred and seventy-nine (9,479) deaths were
recorded; that is, during this period near one-fourth, or more, exactly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
one in 4.2, or 23.3 per cent. terminated fatally. This increase of
mortality was due in great measure to the accumulation of the sources
of disease, as the increase of excrements and filth of all kinds,
and the concentration of noxious effluvia, and also to the progressive
effects of salt diet, crowding, and the hot climate.</p>


<p class="p1 center">CONCLUSIONS.</p>

<p>1st. The great mortality among the Federal prisoners confined in
the military prison at Andersonville was not referable to climatic
causes, or to the nature of the soil and waters.</p>

<p>2d. The chief causes of death were scurvy and its results and
bowel affections—chronic and acute diarrhea and dysentery. The
bowel affections appear to have been due to the diet, and the habits
of the patients, the depressed, dejected state of the nervous system
and moral and intellectual powers, and to the effluvia arising from
the decomposing animal and vegetable filth. The effects of salt meat,
and the unvarying diet of corn-meal, with but few vegetables, and
imperfect supplies of vinegar and sirup, were manifested in the great
prevalence of scurvy. This disease, without doubt, was also influenced
to an important extent in its origin and course by the foul
animal emanations.</p>

<p>3d. From the sameness of the food and form, the action of the
poisonous gasses in the densely crowded and filthy stockade and
hospital, the blood was altered in its constitution, even before the
manifestation of actual disease. In both the well and the sick the
red corpuscles were diminished; and in all diseases uncomplicated
with inflammation, the fibrous element was deficient. In cases of
ulceration of the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal, the
fibrous element of the blood was increased; while in simple diarrhea,
uncomplicated with ulceration, it was either diminished or else
remained stationary. Heart clots were very common, if not universally
present in cases of ulceration of the intestinal mucous membrane,
while in the uncomplicated cases of diarrhea and scurvy, the blood
was fluid and did not coagulate readily, and the heart clots and fibrous
concretions were almost universally absent. From the watery
condition of the blood, there resulted various serous effusions into
the pericardium, ventricles of the brain, and into the abdomen. In
almost all the cases which I examined after death, even the most
emaciated, there were more or less serous effusions into the abdominal
cavity. In case of hospital gangrene of the extremities, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
case of gangrene of the intestines, heart clots and fibrous coagula
were universally present. The presence of these clots in the cases of
hospital gangrene, while they were absent in the cases in which there
were no inflammatory symptoms, sustains the conclusion that hospital
gangrene is a species of inflammation, imperfect and irregular
though it may be in its progress, in which the fibrous element and
coagulation of the blood are increased, even in those who are suffering
from such a condition of the blood, and from such diseases as
are naturally accompanied with a disease in the fibrous constituent.</p>

<p>4th. The fact that hospital gangrene appeared in the stockade
first, and originated spontaneously without any previous contagion,
and occurred sporadically all over the stockade and prison hospital,
was proof positive that this disease will arise whenever the conditions
of crowding, filth, foul air, and bad diet are present. The exhalations
of the hospital and stockade appeared to exert their effects to
a considerable distance outside of these localities. The origin of
hospital gangrene among the prisoners appeared clearly to depend in
great measure to the state of the general system induced by diet, and
various external noxious influences. The rapidity of the appearance
and action of the gangrene depended upon the powers and state of
the constitution, as well as upon the intensity of the poison in the
atmosphere, or upon the direct application of poisonous matter to the
wounded surface. This was further illustrated by the important
fact that hospital gangrene, or a disease resembling it in all essential
respects, attacked the intestinal canal of patients laboring under
ulceration of the bowels, although there were no local manifestations
of gangrene upon the surface of the body. This mode of termination
in case of dysentery was quite common in the foul atmosphere of the
Confederate States Military Hospital, in the depressed, depraved condition
of the system of these Federal prisoners.</p>

<p>5th. A scorbutic condition of the system appeared to favor the
origin of foul ulcers, which frequently took on true hospital gangrene.
Scurvy and hospital gangrene frequently existed in the same
individual. In such cases vegetable diet, with vegetable acids would
remove the scorbutic condition without curing the hospital gangrene.
From the results of the existing war for the establishment of the independence
of the Confederate States, as well as from the published
observations of Dr. Trotter, Sir Gilbert Blane, and others of the English
navy and army, it is evident that the scorbutic condition of the
system, especially in crowded ships and camps, is most favorable to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
the origin and spread of foul ulcers and hospital gangrene. As in
the present case of Andersonville, so also in past times when medical
hygiene was almost entirely neglected, those two diseases were almost
universally associated in crowded ships. In many cases it was very
difficult to decide at first whether the ulcer was a simple result of
scurvy or the action of the prison or hospital gangene, for there was
great similarity in the appearance of the ulcers in the two diseases.
So commonly have those two diseases been confined to their origin
and action, that the description of scorbutic ulsers, by many authors,
evidently includes also many of the prominent characteristics of hospital
gangrene. This will be rendered evident by an examination of
the observations of Dr. Lind and Sir Gilbert Blane upon scorbutic
ulcers.</p>

<p>6th. Gangrenous spots followed by rapid destruction of the tissue
appeared in some cases where there has been no known wound.
Without such well established facts, it might be assumed that the
disease was propagated from one patient to another. In such a filthy
and crowded hospital as that of the Confederate States Military Prison
at Andersonville, it was impossible to isolate the wounded from
the sources of actual contact with gangrenous matter. The flies
swarmed over the wounds and over filth of every kind, the filthy,
imperfectly washed and scanty supplies of rags, and the limited supply
of washing utensils, the same wash-bowl serving for scores of
patients were sources of such constant circulation of the gangrenous
matter that the disease might rapidly spread from a single gangrenous
wound. The fact already stated, that a form of moist gangrene, resembling
hospital gangrene, was quite common in this foul atmosphere,
in cases of dysentery, both with and without the existance of
the entire service, not only demonstrates the dependence of the disease
upon the state of the constitution, but proves in the clearest
manner that neither the contact of the poisonous matter of gangrene,
nor the direst action of the poisonous atmosphere upon the ulcerated
surface are necessary to the development of the disease.</p>

<p>7th. In this foul atmosphere amputation did not arrest hospital
gangrene; the disease almost universally returned. Almost every
amputation was followed finally by death, either from the effects of
gangrene or from the prevailing diarrhea and dysentery. Nitric
acid and escharoties generally in this crowded atmosphere, loaded
with noxious effluvia, exerted only temporary effects; after their application
to the diseased surfaces, the gangrene would frequently returned
with redoubled energy; and even after the gangrene had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
completely removed by local and constitutional treatment, it would
frequently return and destroy the patient. As far as my observation
extended, very few of the cases of amputation for gangrene recovered.
The progress of these cases was frequently very deceptive. I
have observed after death the most extensive disorganization of the
stump, when during life there was but little swelling of the part, and
the patient was apparently doing well. I endeavored to impress upon
the medical officers the view that on this disease treatment was almost
useless, without an abundance of pure, fresh air, nutricious
food, and tonics and stimulants. Such changes, however, as would
allow of the isolation of the cases of hospital gangrene appeared to
be out of the power of the medical officers.</p>

<p>8th. The gangrenous mass was without true puss, and consisted
chiefly of broken-down, disorganized structures. The reaction of
the gangrenous matter in certain stages was alkaline.</p>

<p>9th. The best, and in truth the only means of protecting large
armies and navies, as well as prisoners, from the ravages of hospital
gangrene, is to furnish liberal supplies of well-cured meat, together
with fresh beef and vegetables, and to enforce a rigid system of hygene.</p>

<p>10th. Finally, this gigantic mass of human misery calls loudly for
relief, not only for the sake of suffering humanity, but also on account
of our own brave soldiers now captive in the hands of the Federal
Government. Strict justice to the gallant men of the Confederate
armies, who have been or who may be, so unfortunate as to be
compelled to surrender in battle, demands that the Confederate Government
should adopt that course which will best secure their health
and comfort in captivity; or at least leave their enemies without a
shadow of an excuse for any violation of the rules of civilized warfare
in the treatment of prisoners.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SUMMARY">SUMMARY</h2>
</div>


<p>The variation—from month to month—of the proportion of deaths
to the whole number of living is singular and interesting. It supports
the theory I have advanced above, as the following facts taken
from the official report, will show:</p>

<p class="noindent pad2">
In April one in every sixteen died.<br>
In May one in every twenty-six died.<br>
In June one in every twenty-two died.<br>
In July one in every eighteen died.<br>
In August one in eleven died.<br>
In September one in every three died.<br>
In October one in every two died.<br>
In November one in every three died.<br>
</p>

<p>Does the reader fully understand that in September one-third of
those in the pen died, that in October one-half of the remainder perished,
and in November one-third of those who still survived, died?
Let him pause for a moment and read this over carefully again, because
its startling magnitude will hardly dawn upon him at first reading.
It is true that the fearful disproportionate mortality of those
months was largely due to the fact that it was mostly the sick that
remained behind, but even this diminishes but little the frightfulness
of the showing. Did anyone ever hear of an epidemic so fatal that
one-third of those attacked by it in one month died; one-half of the
remnant the next month, and one-third of the feeble remainder the
next month? If he did his reading has been much more extensive
than mine.</p>

<p>The total number of deceased Union soldiers during and in consequence
of the war, is 316,233. Of these, only 175,764 have been
identified, and the rest will probably remain for ever unknown. Of
the grand total, 36,868 are known to have been prisoners of war who
died in captivity. There are seventy-two National Cemeteries for
the dead of the Union armies, besides which there are 320 local and
Post cemeteries. The largest of the Government grounds are: Arlington,
Va., the former homestead of General Robert E. Lee, 15,547
graves; Fredericksburg, Va., 15,300 graves; Salisbury, N. C., 12,112
graves; Beaufort, S. C., 10,000 graves; Andersonville, Ga., 13,706
graves; Marietta, Ga., 10,000 graves; New Orleans, La., 12,230
graves; Vicksburg, Miss., 17,012 graves; Chattanooga, Tenn., 12,964
graves; Nashville, Tenn., 16,529 graves; Memphis, Tenn., 13,958
graves; Jefferson Barracks, near St. Louis, Mo., 8,601 graves. The
National Cemetery near Richmond, Va. contains 6,276 graves, of
which 5,450 are of unknown dead, mostly prisoners of war. The
cemeteries are kept in good condition, and are generally well sodded
and planted with ornamental trees.</p>

<p>The following is an Appeal to Congress in behalf of the ex-prisoners
of war, issued by Felix LaBaume, President of the “National Ex-Prisoners
of War Association,” and I hope that the united efforts of
every one of the survivors will be concentrated with an object in
view which shall substantially benefit those who performed a most
valuable service in putting down the rebellion, suffering horrors and
privations that cannot fully be described, and for which privations
and sufferings they have never been recognized in the existing pension
laws.</p>


<p class="p2 center">APPEAL TO CONGRESS.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>It is a historical fact that in the early part of 1864, shortly after
the battles of the wilderness, certain high officials of the Federal government
decided that it was more economical to stop the exchange of
prisoners of war entirely.</p>

<p>The policy of non-exchange was understood to be based on the
following facts:</p>

<p>That a soldier counted for more in the Confederate army then acting
on the defensive; that many of the Andersonville prisoners were
men whose term of service had already expired, that all of them were
disabled by starvation and exposure, and unfit for further service,
while every Confederate was able-bodied and “in for the war” so
that an exchange would have been a gratuitous strengthening of the
armies of the Confederacy, which, at the same time, would have prevented
the prisoners held in the South from falling into the hands of
Sherman.</p>

<p>August 14th, 1864, General Grant telegraphed to General Butler:
“It is hard on our men held in Southern prisons, not to exchange
them, but it is humane to those left in the ranks to fight our battles.
If we now commence a system of exchange which liberates all prisoners
taken, we will have to fight on till the whole South is exterminated.
If we hold those captured, they count for more than dead
men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>In accordance with General Grant’s opinion General Butler then
wrote a letter in reply to General Ould’s proposals of exchange.</p>

<p>In his famous Lowell speech, Butler said: “In this letter these
questions were argued justly, as I think, not diplomatically, but obtrusively
and demonstratively, not for the purpose of furthering
an exchange of prisoners, but for the purpose of preventing and
stopping the exchange, and furnishing a ground on which we could
stand.” The men who languished at Andersonville and other Confederate
prisons, played, in their sufferings and death, an active part
in the termination of the war.</p>

<p>This part was not so stirring as charging on guns or meeting in
the clash of infantry lines. But as the victims of a policy, dictated by
the emergency of a desperate condition of affairs, their enforced, long
continued hardships and sufferings made it possible for the Union
generals and their armies to decide the deplorable struggle so much
sooner, and to terminate the existence of the Confederacy by the surrender
at Appomatox. No soldier or seaman, in this or any other
country, ever made such personal sacrifices or endured such hardships
and privations as those who fell into the hands of the Confederates
during the late war. The recital of their sufferings would be
scarcely believed were they not corroborated by so large a number of
unimpeachable witnesses on both sides.</p>

<p>Colonel C. T. Chandler’s C. S. A. report on Andersonville, dated
Aug. 5, 1864, in which he said: “It is difficult to describe the horrors
of the prison, which is a disgrace to civilization,” was endorsed by
Col. R. H. Chilton, Inspector General C. S. A., as follows: “The
condition of the prisoners at Andersonville is a reproach to us as a
nation.”</p>

<p>The sixty thousand graves filled by the poor victims of the several
prisons, tells a story that cannot be denied or misunderstood. When
we consider the hardships and privations to which these men were
subjected, the wonder is not that so many died, but that any survived.
We submit, it is hardly possible that any man who was subjected
to the hardships and inhuman treatment of a Confederate
prison for even two or three months only, could come out any other
than permanently disabled. Statistics show that of those who were
released, nearly five per cent. died before reaching home. In a few
instances there was a roll kept of thirty to fifty of those men who,
when released, were able to travel home alone, and it is now found
that nearly three-fourths of the number have since died.</p>

<p>The roll of the Andersonville Survivors Association shows that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
during the year 1880, the number of deaths averaged sixteen and one-third
per cent. of the total membership, showing an increase of five
per cent. over the death rate of 1879.</p>

<p>But few of the most fortunate of these survivors will live to see
the age of fifty, and probably within the next ten years the last of
them will have passed away.</p>

<p>Congress has from time to time enacted laws most just and liberal
(or that were intended to be so,) toward the men who were disabled
in the late war, but a large majority of the prison survivors are excluded
from a pension under these laws. This comes partly from
the unfriendly spirit in which the pension department has been administered
for the last six years, and partly from the peculiar
circumstances surrounding their several cases.</p>

<p>Many paroled prisoners, on reaching the Union lines were at once
sent home on furlough, without receiving any medical treatment.
The most of these were afterwards discharged under General Order
No. 77, dated War Department, Washington, D. C., April 28th,
1865, because physically unfit for service, and hence there is no official
record whatever as to their disease.</p>

<p>If one of those men applies for a pension, he is called upon to furnish
the affidavit of some army surgeon who treated him after his
release and prior to discharge, showing that he then had the disease
on which he now claims a pension. For reasons stated, this is impossible.
The next thing is a call to furnish an affidavit from some
doctor who treated the man while at home on furlough, or certainly
immediately following his final discharge, showing that he was then
afflicted with identical disease on which pension is now claimed.
This is generally impossible, for many reasons.</p>

<p>In most cases the released prisoner felt it was not medicine he
wanted, but the kindly nursing of mother or wife, and nourishing
food. So no doctor was called, at least for some months
after reaching home. In the instances where the doctor
was called, not infrequently he cannot now be found, cannot
swear that the soldier had any particular disease for the first six
months after reaching home, as he was a mere skeleton from starvation,
and it required months of careful nursing before he had vitality
enough for a disease to manifest itself.</p>

<p>Then again in many cases the poor victim has never suffered from
any particular disease, but rather from a combination of numerous
ills, the sequence of a wrecked constitution commonly termed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
physicians, “General Debility.” But the commissioner refuses to
grant a pension on disease save where the proof is clear and positive
of the contracting of a particular disease while in the service, of its
existence at date of final discharge, and of its continuous existence
from year to year for each and every year, to present date.</p>

<p>In most cases it is impossible for a prison survivor to furnish any
such proof, and hence his application is promptly rejected. Besides
these, there are hundreds of other obstacles in the way of the surviving
prisoner of war who applies for a pension. One thing is, he
is called upon to prove by comrades who were in prison with him,
the origin and nature of his disease, and his condition prior to and at
the time of his release. This is generally impossible, as he was likely
to have but few comrades in prison with whom he was on
intimate terms, and these, if not now dead, cannot be found, they
are men without sufficient knowledge of anatomy and physiology,
and not one out of a hundred could conscientiously swear to the origin
and diagnosis of the applicant’s disease. Is it not ridiculous for
the government to insist upon such preposterous evidence? Which,
if produced in due form, is a rule drawn up by the applicant’s physican,
and sworn to by the witness—“<i lang="la">cum grano salis</i>,”—and in most
cases amounts to perjury for charity’s sake.</p>

<p>Hence, it will be seen the difficulties surrounding the prison survivor
who is disabled and compelled to apply for a pension are so
numerous and insurmountable as to shut out a very large majority
of the most needy and deserving cases from the benefits of the general
pension laws entirely.</p>

<p>We claim, therefore, that as an act of equal justice to these men,
as compared with other soldiers, there ought to be a law passed admitting
them to pensions on record or other proof of confinement in
a confederate prison for a prescribed length of time—such as Bill
4495—introduced by the Hon. J. Warren Keifer, M. C., of Ohio
provides for. And if this bill is to benefit these poor sufferers any,
it must be passed speedily, as those who yet remain will, at best, survive
but a few years longer.</p>

<p>This measure is not asked as a pencuniary compensation for the
personal losses these men sustained, as silver and gold cannot be
weighed as the price for untold sufferings, but it is asked that they
may be partly relieved from abject want, and their sufferings alleviated
to some extent by providing them with the necessaries of life,
for nearly all of them are extremely poor, consequent on the wreck
of their physical and mental powers.</p>

a very correct likeness of our beloved President, who lies
at death’s door, smitten by the hand of the assassin Guiteau.
This is done more in appreciation of the peculiar
sadness of the circumstances and the anxiety of the people,
than because of any connection which the cut may have

<p class="center">Read twice, referred to the Committee on Invalid Pensions,
and ordered to be printed.</p>

<hr class="r30">

<p>Mr. Keifer, by unanimous consent, introduced the following
bill:</p>

<p class="negin1">A BILL granting pensions to certain Union soldiers and
sailors of the late war of the rebellion who were confined
in so called Confederate prisons.</p>

<p class="negin1">Whereas during the late rebellion many soldiers and sailors
of the Federal Army and Navy, through the fortunes of
war, became prisoners and were confined in so called
Confederate prisons, to the detriment and permanent injury
of their health, but whose debility is of such a general
and indefinable character as to exclude them from
the benefits of existing pension laws: Therefore</p>

<p><em>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled</em>, That the
Secretary of the Interior be, and he hereby is, authorized
and required to place upon the pension-rolls of the United
States, upon application and proof being made to the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
of the Department, all honorably discharged soldiers
and sailors of the Federal Army and Navy who, during
the late war, were captured and confined, during the
period of six months or more, in any of the prisons or
places commonly used for the confinement of prisoners by
the so called Confederate authorities during the late rebellion,
and who are not now beneficiaries, nor entitled to become
so under existing pension laws of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> That such pension shall in each case begin from
the date of the discharge of the soldier or sailor aforesaid
from the military or naval service of the United States, and
shall be at the rate of eight dollars per month in cases
where the term of imprisonment shall have been more than
six months and less than one year, and one dollar per
month additional for each full month of such imprisonment
in excess of one year. And the said pension shall be paid
at the same time and in the same manner as other pensions
are paid: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this act shall be construed
to authorize the reduction or to prevent the increase
of the pension of any person now receiving or entitled to
receive the benefits of existing pension laws.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Each line of the List of the Dead gives as much information about
that soldier as was known. A missing item was left blank in the
original book, but has been given a - or — mark in this etext.</p>

<p>The format of each entry is as follows:</p>

<div>Grave number from 1 to 12916.<br>
<p class="pad3 noindent">There are some gaps in the numbering and some duplicates; this
book states a total of 12,912 deaths over the fourteen months.</p></div>

<div>Name with initials or first name, or —— if none known.<br>
<p class="pad3 noindent">If he held a rank other than Private it is added after a comma.
The most common abbreviations are Cor and S’t for Corporal and
Sergeant, but others are used as well.</p></div>

<div>Branch of the Army, if not Infantry.<br>
<p class="pad3 noindent">The most common are Cav for Cavalry, Art for Artillery, Bat for
Battery, Mar for Marine Corps, Cit for Citizen.</p></div>

<div>Cemetery number at Andersonville.<br>
<p class="pad3 noindent">Nearly 200 separate numbered burial areas were used.</p></div>

<div>Assigned Company within Andersonville.<br>
<p class="pad3 noindent">Thirteen groups or Companies, A through M.</p></div>

<div>Recorded date of burial.<br>
<p class="pad3 noindent">Month and day. The year 1864 is assumed, unless 65 is added
after the date. The following entries will be assumed 65 as
well, until a 64 is given, indicating a reversion to 1864.
The original book also placed a 64 (sometimes 65) at the
first entry on a book page, and these have not been removed.</p></div>

<p class="p2">The first few pages covering Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware and
District of Columbia, had the ‘Cemetery’ before the ‘Branch’ field
when that was present; also a few in Illinois; for example ‘1  Cav’
and ‘2  Art’. These have been reversed to ‘Cav 1’ and ‘Art 2’ to be
consistent with the rest of the List.</p>

<p>In most pages of the later States (Massachusetts to Pennsylvania)
the rank was missing; this has been added (Cor or S’t), when
present in the Library of Congress (LoC) source document.</p>

<p>In some cases the service branch has been changed to a shorter
abbreviation of 3-5 characters to maintain the table format. For
example ‘Tenn St Gd’ or similar has been changed to ‘StG’;
‘St Militia’ or similar has been changed to ‘Mil’; ‘Mar Corps’ or
similar has been changed to ‘Mar’; ‘Sig Corps’ or similar has been
changed to ‘Sig’.</p>

<p>A few names had different spelling in this List versus the LoC
document. In general the List spelling has been retained unless
clearly a typo.</p>

<p class="p2">Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors in the diary
and in the List have been corrected after careful comparison with
other occurrences within the text and reference to the LoC
document.</p>

<p>Some hyphens in words have been silently removed, some added,
when a predominant preference was found in the original book.</p>

<p>Except for those changes in the diary text noted below, all
misspellings in the text, and inconsistent or archaic usage,
have been retained.</p>
